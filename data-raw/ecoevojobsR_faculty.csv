I enjoyed doing my PhD there and new faculty seemed to fit into the community quickly. 4) Queer person who did my PhD there - it is very small and isolated, ~1.5 hours from Spokane which is the nearest large airport, shopping location, etc. It has gotten better in Pullman since I left (i.e. they opened a target so now you can shop there instead of having to drive to spokane for such a luxury), but it is still a small community if you have any sort of historically-excluded identity. The health care can also be very difficult given how rural it is, a lot of my queer friends had to drive the 6+ hours for gender affirming surgeries in Seattle so if you need any sort of 'specialty care' beware. You can definitely find community there, but it takes some effort. The Moscow Coop, the Moscow Farmer's Market and the roller derby teams were all highlights of the area along with the aforementioned outdoor activities 5) I am a junior PI in this dept and want to share that I have been amazed at how supportive the community in this department is; it is incredibly collegial and everyone has been very friendly and helpful. Setting up a lab is dang hard and everyone I work with, from faculty to staff to the college admin, has wanted to help me succeed. Pullman/Moscow is a pretty cool college town with a surprisingly great food scene and easy access to stunning outdoor recreation. I worked with a number of people who had lived in this area before moving here and almost all of them wanted to move back.

If a Duke person is reading this you are welcome to pass that to your superiors. 7) Agree that the herbarium thing sucks, but what I want to know is whether it's worth applying to this position as a non plant, non fungus person? 8) @ ""Someone from Duke"": Sure, it may be relocated close by (btw, since it would no longer be the Duke Herbarium, ""shut down"" isn't inaccurate), but the issue is what it says about the support for plant/fungal organismal biology to be expected from department and university leadership. I was here and would strongly urge folks who care about non-model organisms to avoid this department. 8) @7 This is a department that has been wiling to waste a lot of people's time in past searches with criteria NOT in the job ad, so proceed at your own risk. For what it's worth, I don't believe the ""especially plant/fungal biology"" and think it is just a bone thrown to faculty in those areas after last year's ""any area of biology"" search ended up with a near-total animal focus. 9) Were any hires made from that search last year? x2 10) Yes, multiple hires were made. 11) I’m curious whether marine ecologists, with broad contributions to ecology, would still be considered for this Department, or if they might be seen as a better fit for the Duke Marine Lab and therefore less likely to be selected.

Also, any insights into whether there are specific courses they are looking to fill? The ad is very broad...1) As 4 mentioned, this ia a debate every year. But since the ad literally says tenure track, I posted as such. I debated if I should put the rank as Asst Prof of Teaching though. I'm curious if PoTs are able to do research with undergrads (ad mentioned mentoring). 6) @5 one of my good friends is a PoP at Davis (different dept), his research is focused on pedagogy, Teaching-as-Research types of investigations. 1) I looked up the current PoT's in EVE and their research is also pedagogical.  7) Search commitee chair here, rank is correct for assistant professor of teaching; this position is eligible for the equivalent of tenure for ladder rank faculty; expectation is to have scholarly activities around teaching and pedagogy, which can include pedagogical research, discipline-based education, or assessment research among other areas and activities.  Some PoTs at UCD also have disciplinary research as part of their programs, but expectation is to have components of pedagogical and educational research.  8) Thanks for the clarification, SC! Just to confirm then the statement of research should be on pedagogical research? 9) May be worth changing the subject area section to reflect this. x2 10) Yes, your research statement should make clear how you will engage in furthering the science of science teaching, pedagogy, assessment, etc. 1) @10 I don't know if is possible for the committee to edit the job ad, but it might be worth adding that info to the research statement description.

Like #2 said, Hillsborough and Pinellas have large urban swaths that are democratic or democratic leaning. However, #2 overstated the cost of living in Tampa. It has gone up in the past 5 years or so, but it is still slightly lower than the national average. Also, they overstated the cost of family homes.

Perhaps, though, people are reading into discussions of the university as a whole... 10) Eh, some of those new hires are definitely upholding old traditions. It's a mixed bag, as with most places. 11) @10 on what basis are you making these allegations?  12) I interviewed there, the chalk talk was rough, some professors were intentionally repeating the same intense question with comments such as ""At Harvard we do XYZ"", that tension has not happened in other Ivy leagues, I think that culture is not necessary for excellence. My host was nice though. 13) Interesting @12. I'm current pd in OEB, and have not experienced that specific thing here. Absolutely have at 2 other interviews (not ivies but very wealthy highly ranked places, 1 in Europe). In both cases it was old white men though. 14) For all candidates out there, don't get your hopes very high with this particular position as they are opening it as a Tenure Track mainly to recruit a specific professor from Princeton University. Therefore, if you want to have a chance, also try applying to the other OEB positions listed above. 15) Can anyone comment on the Nature/Science pub expectations here? I've seen from other Ivy that they only consider CVs with such pubs, but I know many places are trying to change that culture... 16) Current postdoc in OEB. Multiple of the interviewed candidates last year had no CNS, although I think most or maybe all had something like PNAS or Nature comms. 17) @15 it is completely untrue that Ivys or other similarly prestigious places require you to have CNS (or K99 or whatever ""requirements"" people make up) to be hired. 18) To get tenure at Harvard you have to be quantifiably at the top of your [sub]field. While there's no strict requirements to get hired, you have to prove that you are on track to be ""the best"" at what you do. I don't see how that's possible without flashy highly cited pubs. 17) @18 sure, and that's kind of the case at any top school, but we're talking about getting hired, not getting tenure. CNS is neither necessary nor is it sufficient to get you a job.18) @17 you might want to re-read my comment, buddy 19) More helpful (from a purely empirical standpoint) is if you've held a Harvard junior fellowship or at least have studied at another Ivy. 20) Worht looking at what % of TT hires actually get tenure there... 21) yea the comment about CNS for getting hired vs tenure is relevant but like...do you really want to barely manage to get the job there only to find that you are expected to massively overperform for the next 5 years or you lose tenure? getting tenure in this department is no walk in the park.","2","Match, exact","Harvard University","MA",166027,"Cambridge","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences focus, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority graduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Not Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Midsize","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",2,1943,4949,681,783,0,8358,1116344,123639,7147,1627,85,100,350,146,535,146,1468,4264,1836,107,0,2,31655,41024,30391,22817,8527,21864,5503,596,196,2232,13331,8533,1404,0,13,0,NA,NA,26,52,NA,1446,0.173008,37,174,32,0.864865,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,24,22,13694,1007,634,720,740,1460,33,32,32.38635,40248,2015,0.050065,3

(2) It's not clear which documents are required, also unofficial UG and grad transcripts required? 3) does anyone know much about the dept culture and teaching load? 4) search committee member here. Sorry, the UG transcripts are required because of HR, I know it's weird. The things the search committee is requesting are cover letter, CV, three reference letters, and 2-page research and teaching statements that incorporate contributions to DEI. If there's anything else on the platform that is required is stuff HR added. The teaching load is often 1-2. One of those classes if often a ""biggish class"" (anywhere from 30 to 100 students), one class that relates to the expertise of the faculty (in this case something on evolution), and a third class which is usually a 1 credit seminar. The department is diverse in terms of topics and expertise, there's an imbalance in terms of ranks, so there's a lot of full proffesors and very few jr faculty but there's upcoming hires in the next few years to balance things out. In terms of collaborations, it really depends on what you work with, there's a bunch of animal people in the department so this hire should have plenty of people to collaborate with. Faculty are nice and colleagial with your usual 1-2 exceptions who we all hope they will retire soon.    5) do insects count as animals or is this a vertebrate biology position? 6) Any animal is welcomed not only vertebrates. 7) SC member here - our new HR platform is .... not great. It automatically requests transcripts from *all* applicants. Transcripts are not a required document and you do not have to upload those (they should show up as an ""optional"" document on the application platform); the committee will not be considering transcripts during application review. Also note that the closing date for applications is 10/25/24 and letters will be requested after the search closes. Yes, this is another annoying feature of our HR platform that we are trying our best to work around. There may be some incorrect deadlines floating around - the actual deadline is that one on the university site, which is 10/25/24 for applicants and 11/1/24 for letters. Questions can also be directed to biosearch@nmsu.edu, which is monitored daily.

Also, on top of salary employer annually pays retirement savings (superannuation) of 17% i.e. at least $20,881. @2 under Aus system we typically have no statements and include all material in the cover letter under each of the job criteria (similar to UK applications). @6 just tried application portal and seems to be working for me. Wanted to make a general comment that these types of positions are 'permanent' as there is no tenure-track in Aus, but startup is almost non-existent. 8) Current Australian academic and wanted to add to @7. The positions are 'permanent' but there is commonly a 1-4 year (varies wildly accross universities) probation period where you will need to meet certain performance benchmarks. These are fairly reasonable, however, and is nowhere near as tough as applying for tenure 9) Guess I learned my lesson that this was 9/8/2024 local time... 10) Found the application very confusing. Wrote a specific cover letter, teaching and research statement tailored to the dept and ecology research in Australia. Suddenly my application was submitted with no clear place to have uploaded a cover letter or supporting documents, just two tiny text boxes with vague instructions. Not crossing my fingers😂 11) adding to others here with Aus experience. You do not need to submit additional materials required for jobs in other countries. The ""cover letter"" is not just a cover letter - you specifically need to address all the selection criteria and all unis have guidelines on how to do this. So the cover letter ends up being like 4-5 pages often. 12) @11, thanks for that. Woops... guess this one was a practice run. 11) @12 didn't mean to be negative, was just trying to stop anyone doing any extra unneeded work, you never know! Fingers crossed for you. If you submitted extra materials I am sure that's fine too, like I said just trying to avoid people needlessly doing extra.","14","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I agree with @7 I'll also add that Pittsburgh is a cool city and there is a good network of evolutionary biologists across departments and universities here 9) @2 so the committee is looking for theoretical/computational and lab, no field ecologists need apply? x2 10) I'm pretty sure the ad, and 2, said that ONE of the positions is for computational/theoretical.. the other position could presumably be more broad? 11) @10 the other position is stated  to be for researchers utilizing any range of laboratory-based techniques, so does that mean someone who primarily conducts field work will not be competitive if they also don't incoporate lab based techniques?  12) Any one else having trouble with the app site? Nothing shows up on the Letters of Rec page for me. x3 12 again) answering my own question, in case it helps anyone else: I reached out to HR and this happens because you're supposed to direct your letter writers to email their letters to the email address in the job ad. No email request will be generated for them. 13) can someone from the search committee confirm that they are not interested in field ecologists? x3 14) thanks 12! 15) From search committee member: field-based research is perfectly acceptable as a component of the research for both positions advertised.

Chair the EcoMap program; 1) is this a joke?? ""Highly accomplished scientific researcher"".. 5 years experience leading a lab… salary? Barely over 100K… in Boston…yikes 2) Was a postdoc at BU making 55k... they upped minimum postdoc pay to 65k while I was there, but still not great 1 again) year it's a big step up from postdoc salary, but from the description the position is close to equivalent with a tenured faculty position/assoc prof, but paying maybe starting TT salary for the area? and low starting salary for a TT position in Boston at that. 3) They note that this is a 9-month position with expectations that part of the role would include fundraising for the remaining months. Any chance they’re listing the 9-month commitment? If so, the annual total would be closer to $150K which is looking more reasonable. 4) Maybe so, but you're unlikely to have the additional 3 mo of full time support in every year, so don't go into this (or any 9 mo academic position) expecting that you'll regularly be making the 12 month equivalent. 5) If I'm reading it right, it does look like this position is hybrid and primarily remote and you can live in MA, NY, RI, VT, NH, or ME. 6) still not competitive in that area if it's equivalent to associate level as it reads, even at nine months. 7) I was offered this position last cycle and came very close to taking it. It's a very cool opportunity, but I definitely think the fit needs to be right. I can't comment on the updated search, but last cycle the salary was for the full 12 mo (the 3 mo fundraising is an expectation - does not raise your salary). It is also completely remote, which could be a great perk, but also a challenge. The NE Aquarium will pay for travel to Boston over a certain radius. I will try to check back if there are more questions. I wish this position had worked out for me as the people were genuinely great - just wouldn't have worked for my family at the moment. Good luck! 8) Salary is not a joke...also it's a 12 month position but because there is service you are soft money for 9 months and on the institution's dime for the other 3.","","Unmatched",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

That said, you're pretty close to Salt Lake City, which is a great, liberal city... consider commuting if you get the job. 3) I work here. easy to live in SLC and there's a free train straight to UVU campus. all faculty get free public transit so it's easy to commute! 4). I also work here and commute in from SLC. I love living in SLC and the commute on the train is free and easy to do work, as it has wifi. There is a strong focus on work-life-balance here as well, which is nice. I'm also on the search committee if anyone has any questions! 5) @4: I will apply to this job since it looks like a good fit! How much does faith/religion affect teaching evolutionary concepts? Coming from OK/TX, I have some experience, but not sure how it differs in UT. 5) I don't work there but I do work in Utah and Mormons are actually fairly okay with evolution. It is taught at BYU and they modify some language around it like saying ""adaptation"" instead of ""natural selection"", but they seem to compartmentalize fairly well. I have a colleague who is non-LDS who teaches at BYU and he said teaching evolution has never really been an issue. The weirder thing is praying before faculty meetings (they don't do that at UVU thankfully). 6)@5, 4 here, I actually teach some sections of Evolution here, as well as teaching evolution in intro classes, and never really have much pushback. There's actually some great work by some in the department on the acceptance of topics and concepts that tend to be controversial, such as vaccines, evolution, climate change, etc. in our non-major introductory courses. Really cool stuff 7) A friend interviewed here last year and really liked the place and people. 8) Anyone have a sense of the entry level salary there? 9) @8 as it's a public university, salary information is available online for each faculty member through https://transparent.utah.gov/.

There's a lot of interest at SAIC in producing art majors that are engaged, well-rounded, and solve real-world problems. They're hiring a physical scientist as well. 4) does anyone have information about research capacity? I would be curious to hear a bit about what types of infrastructure and facilities are available, which obviously would have a big impact on what research a candidate might propose to do in lab classes or as their topic of study 5) Seems like a great place if you have collaborators at UChicago or UIC 6) I think it is unlikely we are going to get more clarification on this job from anyone in this forum. It's likely an email is needed for some clarification on things 7) Did anyone notice one of the writing samples needed is 2 example course syllabi? That is rather unusual, and not something I've seen in a job ad before 8) I have had to submit syllabi for TT jobs before 9) x3, and honestly it feels odd that this is uncommon. Teaching is typically 30-50% of the workload at many R1 institutions. Maybe they want to hire people who are actually qualified to teach? 6 again) I would again implore folks to email ahead. Seems like a teaching-focused or entirely teaching position to me. The previous ""biology"" teacher is an artist with a wikipedia page, not a scientist. Even though this says ""research"" I have big doubts. 10) this posting seems similar to the MassArt job posted last year, anyone here apply to that? 11) someone in my family was a math prof here (now retired). he enjoyed it and taught cool classes on geometry in art and nature. but they didn't offer even calculus, and i imagine bio would be similar- i.e. they want creative classes","10","Match, exact","School of the Art Institute of Chicago","IL",143048,"Chicago","Special Focus Four-Year: Arts, Music & Design Schools","Arts & sciences focus, high graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Other-dominant, with Arts & Sciences","Four-year, full-time, selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, small, primarily residential","Not Classified","Great Lakes IL IN MI OH WI","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,649,278,0,0,0,927,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,210,68,649,0,0,0,3682,3862,3132,2837.333333,2487,645,2141,346,0,0,549,96,429,25,132,13,NA,NA,6,50,NA,838,0.903991,3,11,3,1,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,6,0,1057,182,136,560,488,1050,22,20,20.855346,6530,5079,0.777795,2

But Biology at SFU includes significant research strength in ecology and evolutionary biology, and we would love to see applications from ecologists or evolutionary biologists who study, for example, invasive species impacts and control, the evolution of host/parasite interactions, the mechanisms of selection in new environments vs. the home range, etc.  The focus on a practical question (pests and their control) as mandated in the endowment doesn't change the need for that larger conceptual foundation of the research our new colleague will do.

Curious what organismal courses they might need filled. 2) yes, someone [speciality removed -AP] is leaving. 3) Colby had another member in ecology leave a year or two ago, I wonder what's up with that. I know they moved on to a better gig, but wondering if Colby is not a great place to live or is a great launching pad to bigger and R1s. 4) this search is replacing someone who was denied tenure 5) @1, the ad says physiological ecology 5) I wonder how common tenure denial is here. Seems like many universities due it to save money 6) It seems easier to get denied tenure at elite SLACs because the bar is so high for teaching while you also can't slack on research. 7) What is the typical bar for research outputs at a place like that? Admittedly I haven't interviewed at any ""elite SLACs"", but I have interviewed at some and heard from folks at others and the most common response is that a single publication with undergrad co-authors by the time you go up for tenure is sufficient. 8) I interviewed at Colby last year. The expectation is more like 1-2 pubs per year. Some of the labs are shockingly large and productive for a SLAC/PUI (5-10 students, more during the summer). It's not uncommon for the more productive profs to leave for R1-type institutions. 9) Was FT temp faculty at Colby, a decade ago the tenure rate was about 2/3, which I guess is on the lower end. 10) can anyone speak to the expect sallary range? 11) 3 letters required upfront for the application 12) I really hate that people are trying to ""figure out"" why positions are opening, because some of these comments border on gossip. We shouldn't be telling peoples' stories without their consent. I get why people might want to know about a toxic climate, but outing someone for not getting tenure seems uncool to me. We just don't know what peoples' circumstances are. 13) Eh, I think it's important to know why a position is available. No one is named or outed here - that would violate the rules of the board. 14) @ 13 someone was outed in the initial comment by naming the specialty, and it looks like the mod deleted it. So yeah, that was not cool IMO. 15) Does anyone know if we are meant to submit a separate teaching and research statement, or one statement that speaks to both? The posting says one thing, then interfolio suggests another, and there's no contact info on the website. Also unsure of the length they are expecting... X3. 16) @15 Search committee member here. We are expecting a single file that has all three elements within. I am personally expecting to see for most applications about 2 pages each under headings (Research, Teaching, and Inclusive pedagogy). For example, the three separate files you are submitting for other similar institutions can simply be put together in a single doc/pdf. @5 I also want to clarify that we are looking for a population ecologist, or organismal ecologist (including physiological ecology), because we have a community ecologist in the department. 17) Interfolio is asking for letters of rec (3 required files), but the posting just asks for the contact info for references, should we submit a separate document for each contacts information? 18) I couldn't find a way to upload a file. I had to request the letters through Interfolio to be able to submit the application. 19) @15,16,17 Interfolio is asking for things separately or different than the job posting...any way to change the settings so we can give you what you want (i.e. one file with research/teaching/inclusivity and reference contacts) 20) @19 Apologies, this has just been fixed.

But, tht was for a non-tt job. I have no idea about this, would expect it to be low because its a freaking megauniversity. 2 again) I ask because most R1 EEOB dept have 1-1 teaching load, but Biology depts often have 1-0. So I'm wondering whether teaching load is lower here even in comparison with other R1s given that it's a Bio dept 4) teaching load is typically 1.5 (so one class every year, then either a co-taught course, or one run every other year). It's very reasonable! Also lots of microbial work here: https://www.huck.psu.edu/institutes-and-centers/microbiome-center 5) does anyone know who the search chair is or have an email we can contact with questions about the position? 6) Would Behavioral Ecology fall into the scope of the position? 7) It does say the broad field of Ecology so I would say that means open game for any level of Ecology but climate change is shouted out specifically @5) if you email the department head (https://science.psu.edu/bio/contact-us) she can pass along questions to the search chair 8) Am I doing somthing wrong? It seems that all I need to do to apply is to apload CV and answer some biographic qustions, no reserch statements etc. Am I missing somthing? @8) I think you upload everything together since it includes 'additional documents' and the job ad asks for additional things like the research statement 9) I don't see anywhere how many pages research/teaching statement is supposed to be, is it just assumed 2 pages each? 10) If there's no limits I think it's free for all.. I did 2-2-4 (research statement being 4 because I added the list of publications with some annotations as to why I selected those three pubs) 11) 3 pg. research, 2pg teaching, 2pg dei is my default if there are no explicit page lengths given 12) search closed or turned down? email says ""we are closing [the position] and will not be continuing in the recruitment process"" x5 13) TBH, pretty frustrating to ask people to put together applications and then cancel the search 1 week after the deadline... x3 14) Definitely disappointing. Totally disrespectful of the time and care people put into applying. x4 15) also frustrating as i, and others maybe?, chose to focus on this position and not apply for the evolutionary genomics as this was a better fit… to cancel it one week later, right at the deadline for the other position is especially shitty. x2 16) I'm trying to have sympathy that many things can be out of the control of the department and search committee and we may never know why they closed this search, but I'm having a hard time understanding what could have happened in only 1 week that they couldn't have seen this coming and saved a lot of people a lot of work x2 17) I am fairly sure this is just saying they are not accepting more applications, NOT that the search is cancelled! 18) @17 read the email again. search is definitely cancelled.

Guess they didn't make tenure? 2) I think you're remembering a vertebrate physiology position from 2021. The last ecologist search was about 10 years ago. 3) Anyone have any idea what the salary is like? Looks like an expensive area! 4) The last ecology search was in 2019, they hired a marine ecologist but a tenured terrestrial ecologist left and took a nearby job shortly after. This is a wonderful department full of supportive and friendly people. It is expensive, but when I interviewed they had a support system to help with housing next to campus, the salary was competative, and they offered a really good startup for a PUI (about what I got at an R2). The school has excellent resources and many nearby connections with a beautiful campus for terrestrial ecology. 5) Does terrestrial ecology include amphibians that can be both freshwater and terrerstrial? What does ""terrestrial"" mean in job ads like these typically? Does it just mean not marine? Not fisheries? 6) @ 5 c'mon dude... 7) @ 6 I was afraid of that response. Do better. There are many amphibian species surrounding the university that never use bodies of water and their entire life history is on land. 8) Have to have a PhD at time of application? is this something I could reach out to the chairs about as I will have my PhD in December and believe I am competitive for this position? 9) @5, my interpretation (as primarily an organismal biologist) is that 'terrestrial ecology' is targeting an ecosystem-level perspective, not a organism/species/taxa level. x3 10) Maybe @8, but you may want to bark up other trees. Wellesley is in a very different category than many PUIs and unless you have an exceptional record you will likely be rejected from the jump. 11) Ad says PhD required at time of application and, although not stated in this ad, most top-tier liberal arts colleges require postdoc experience and/or a substantial record of reserach productivity post-PhD. 12) Yeah, as much as it sucks to say, anyone's chances of getting a tenure-stream position at a place like Wellesley right out of graduate school are extremely low. Never hurts to try though, it's good practice and will give you an excuse to work on materials you might have put off until later. 13) It's worth applying though. Some of these fancy SLACs really like to hire ABD grad students that they think are rising stars. I know several people who have landed at schools like Wellesley that way. 8) ya i think so too and thanks for the advice everyone! 14) @9 & @5, I disagree about the ecosystem ecologist, since they want someone to teach an organimal course and ecosystem ecologists tend to abstract organisms into pools/trophic levels. Typically, we use ""terrestrial"" to contrast with ""aquatic,"" and the latter has intellectual and methological histories and practices that differ from Ecology/ESA-type ecology, which is largely terrestrially-oriented. 15) Year 14 is how I think most jobs use the term terrestrial and to suppor that the previous ecology job here in 18-19 was advertised as 'aquatic ecology' 16) Terrestrial ecology CAN mean anything as long as it is not restricted to aquatics. You just need to demonstrate the breadth of knowledge required of an ecologist and sell yourself as the best candidate, oh, and look the part on paper. 17) Horrible application system. Letters required up front, but you can't submit the letter request until you submit all of your own material. 18) Yea, weird app site. I just pass on these extra effort postings unless it is really in an area I have some preexisting attachment to. 19) Does terrestrial mean they are wanting someone with a field component of their research or should quantitative/theoretical ecologists still apply? 19) Looking for some clarity on the LOR issue--does this mean letters are due 9/15? And that we should apply before then to give time for the letters to submit? Or do we think there's some flexibility on when letters come in? 20) reached out about the LOR confusion - HR recommends having letter writers send their letters to Working@wellesley.edu and then the letters will be manually added to your application packet after you formally submit everything. Ideally this reduces the stress of not giving your writers any way to submit something until the 15th (lol when most of us will actually submit our applications). But it does seem like the letters are due by the 15th... 19) @20 thanks for clarifying! 21) No diversity statement and a bizarre claim that gender = sex assigned at birth (weirdly called 'birth sex') gives me pause about DEI efforts. Can anyone speack to the culture at the institution re these decisions? 22) I don't actually even see an option to submit recommender information in the application? Update: The request for recommender info comes immediately after you submit. 23) Does anyone know WHEN on thr 15th the deadline is?","15","Match, exact","Wellesley College","MA",168218,"Wellesley","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence","Not classified (Exclusively Undergraduate)","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Exclusively undergraduate four-year","Four-year, small, highly residential","Not Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Suburb Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","Yes","No","No","No",0,713,0,0,0,0,713,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,659,54,0,0,2519,2735,2280,2252,2280,0,2237,23,1,19,0,0,581,0,12,0,NA,NA,16,45,NA,168,0.235624,39,0,0,0,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,0,0,0,2198,371,216,680,670,1350,31,29,29.735945,6581,1343,0.204072,3

This is an edge case between postdoc and permanent, but let's put such pipeline positions here for better visibility. - AP 2) Three reference letters upfront 3) Can someone explain to a non-American how these transition positions work? Don't you risk getting brushed off (or stuck) after the alleged post-doc period ends and never get to the TT-part of the job? I am asking because if I consider making (another) international move it has to be for a position that has a high probability of becoming permanant...hence why this hiring structure strikes me a s a bit odd, but it is probably because I am not familar with the US system. 4) @3, such positions are uncommon here, but are a relatively new mechanism designed to diversify the professorate. Technically open to anyone, but there's an emphasis on understanding the experiences of underrepresented groups. How likely is it to advance to a TT position is unclear and depends on the university, but at least its a prestigious postdoc that should open some doors somewhere. 5) Former UM postdoc: Most (if not all) of the presidential fellows I met at UM transitioned to tenure track jobs either at UM or elsewhere. I think some of them even negotiated startup, salary, etc... for the tenure track phase when hired as postdocs. 6) I recently interviewed for a similar program - THEY ARE AWESOME. Everyone gets promoted to TT eventually (some people linger as postdocs for longer though), but the postdoc period gives you time to learn about the department, finish up leftover papers from previous positions, and wrap your head around tenure requirements before the clock starts. 7) Is there a limit on the number of years after obtaining a PhD to be considered eligible? x2 8) When I go to the link it says they aren't reviewing until 12/24 and start date is 01/25. Just checked with committee and deadline is Aug 31st for materials to be submitted. Does the updated review date indicate a closer start date? 9) @8 I think there are two stages, one within SEAS to pick a candidate to apply at the university level 10) do you have to have a faculty member agree to support your application before applying? 11) Any idea when applicants hear back to know if they will apply for the broader fellowship? 12) Has to be well before 11/01 seeing at that is the campus deadline!

Does anyone know if they would consider someone with a non-avian focus but meets all other criteria? 4) not sure but if you have the relevant background skills I'd say apply just in case!","","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(2) yes.  Five teaching 'units' per year where a lecture/lab course is two units.  Class sizes rarely exceed 20 students. (3) does anyone have any intel on whether this is an internal hire? Looks like the department currently has a physiologist as a VAP (4) @3 you worry too much.  The only time an internal candidate has a significant advantage is if that individual is a spouse of an employee, hence placebound and often negotiated in previous hire.  Internal candidates have an advantage in that all the good points are seen internally.  HOWEVER, the disadvantage is that all the bad points are seen internally too!  If you are a VAP and looking for a perm job, you can not give 100% to the current position, or at least you shouldn't.  Some insitututions regualarly hire VAPs, others seldom or never do.  See how many of the current faculty were VAPs.  Probably next to none. The added advantage to a non-internal candidate is that they are the bright-shiny-new thing. Even if not better, they are shiny new.  Keep that in mind.  Also, if you look at your CV vs the VAP, you can make sure you call out things (without being obvious) that you definitely do or have done better than that candidate. An internal candidate is not something to be afraid of.  Most do not become permanent. (5) @3 and @4 I would tend to agree with @4, but I applied to a position at UR last year, got invited for a campus visit and full day interview with teaching presentation. Was praised highly by the dean for the narrative of my teaching statement. They eventually hired the VAP that had been there for 5+ years. So I think it depends. That being said, I agree with 4 that you should not worry too much or let it deter you from applying. Worry about your packet, not your competition. There are A LOT of scenarios that can play out. This is a gorgeous school and a great group of faculty. They are helpful, answer question thoughtfully, and treat their interviewees very well during campus visits! 6) I would say that, on average, internal candidates have an advantage simply as known entities.  But that rarely means they are a shoe-in - many candidates have their own advantages/elements that make them stand out.","4","Match, exact","University of Richmond","VA",233374,"University of Richmond","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Other-dominant, with Arts & Sciences","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Midsize","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,1027,104,0,116,0,1247,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,7,213,603,424,0,31,3914,4534,4056,3754.666667,3323,733,3136,168,1,18,467,266,787,24,34,20,NA,NA,20,52,NA,414,0.331997,41,8,3,0.073171,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,4,0,2875,482,329,630,650,1280,30,27,28.217016,12060,3727,0.309038,3

But it's a toxic environment in this dept, HK has its own issues politically, expectations to get tenure are Nature and Science papers. I'd think very carefully before making a move.4). Following on 3), do not apply, department is toxic-these positions are being advertised because people are leaving and others expected not to get tenure. 5) What is the salary for the Assistant and for the Associate positions? Folks here say 'high', but is there a number? 6) the numbers on glassdoor are correct. But there is no amount high enough to justify the toxicity and the damage taking one of these positions would do to your career. Do yourself a huge favor and *stay away*. 7) Can somebody post the salary? 4) (again) salary will vary based on the position, HK has high salaries so it will be higher than comparable jobs elsewhere. As 3 and 7 note- avoid it, it's seriously not worth it and these positions are only being advertised because they know people will leave, and many of the hires since 2019 have or will leave. Suggest reaching out to current staff (especially more junior staff) if you are considering applying- you should also likely read these for HK as a whole https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3251032/hong-kong-public-universities-record-new-high-academic-staff-departures-380-leaving-jobs https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/news/hong-kong/article/3251081/academic-staff-departure-rate-hong-kong-public-universities-highest-handover and for HKU other HK universities are getting enquiries from this department in particular about moving within HK for those with families who can't easily leave Hong Kong. 8) I was a previous faculty at another university in Hong Kong. I was there for three years. Salaries are rougly comparable among the UGC-funded eight Hong Kong universities. Here you can see the salary range at Lingnan Univ. https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/201805/23/P2018052300447_284322_1_1527071074119.pdf My salary was exactly around the mean salary given in page 2, and those of my colleagues were too. You usually get 20,000HKD as housing allowance in addition to that salary. Salary is really good, but recruiting overseas postdocs are very difficult (housing is too expensive), basic science is not well-funded, research space in HK is generally very limited, and PhD student quota is very limited (even if you have funding, it doesn't mean you can just employ them as many as you want). It's true that my department was really toxic and a lot of faculty left (including two deans), but I don't know whether HKU is toxic, and I cannot generalize that all universities in HK are toxic. Hong Kong universities are now under a very strong control from the mainland government, and university leaders are now mostly from mainland China. In general, you are expected not to make political statements there. I would say that the pro of HKU is that it is one of the best schools in Asia. The students there are VERY smart and has a very good pool of PhD candidates. I may consider applying to HKU, but I am very curious how toxic it is and whether they can provide decent space for research. 9) This department in particular is incredibly toxic, which likely caused the statements above. As they said, faculty are leaving this department for other HK universities because it is particularly noxious. It's true the undergraduate students are excellent, but undergraduate teaching is not valued. Space distribution is highly variable - some have excellent space and facilities, others are in conditions not conducive to conducting research. It seems to depend on personal relationships and stochastic factors. I would go to CUHK, CityU, HKUST over this particularly dire corner of HK.10). Yeah this department is very very toxic, and the housing allowance is lower than what is quoted above (about 12-14k for Assistant Profs, and 18 for Assoc profs), and may only last for the 1st few years someone comes to HK, plus assistant professors are not allowed to be in the staff housing as they are ""not senior enough"" (that housing is a bit more subsidised). If you are considering HK, go to South China-startups are likely higher and cost of living lower, plus many packages to attract international talent or literally any other HK uni, as many HKU staff are. Annual salary rise also likely below the rate of inflation. To be honest- this thread has at least 2 current members of faculty commenting-it is always wise to heed warnings of staff in a place, I would not recommend anyone consider joining this department at present, there is no space or support, and newer staff were all told misleading (erroneous) information during negociations, which is one reason one left in under a year. Also important to note, serious issues with health and safety in the workplace, constant construction for over a year, black mold round the building-including airvents, poor ventilation and regular noxious gases in corridors and some offices due to ineffective ventilation 11) Sounds like it's literally toxic! 12) 8 again. It's true that construction is being done everywhere endlessly in HK unis, making workplaces noizy and dusty all the time. 13). Yeah, every definition of toxic, and if we have important zoom meetings we have to just work from home as its so noisy (over a year of work on the building so far, including often drilling into walls above your head or behind you, or hammering metal-which noise cancelling headphones does not block), toxic chemicals, and no one with power cares about employee health or welfare. 14) Did anyone hear back? 15) Any information about start-ups of recent faculties? 12). Likely won't start shortlisting until August. Startups also went down, so about 1/2 of those in South China now- limit will likely be 2 million HKD, maybe lower (and yeah, anyone considering it is crazy given the warnings- the conditions literally make staff sick) ","2","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
