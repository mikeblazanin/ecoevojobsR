Yep, application requires answering some values questions related to the Fransican sponsorship. The university staff/faculty include folks from all faith traditions (including none), and these values are extremely broad, e.g. ""Peace and Justice"" and ""Responsible Stewardship"". I've judged this document as the university's way of assuring that they are hiring people who at least reflect on moral issues and can talk about them in the classroom.  Second, yes the political science program was removed last year. Faculty voted against it, seemed like a very complex issue involving some big personalities that I can't really speak on. However, admin is very determined to shape offerings in order to best match their aggressive strategic plan, which is tough to retort since enrollments are climbing and more and more investments are being made in buildings and successful majors/programs. Place is not struggling financially in the broad scheme of things and biology is a big part of uni's goals. Lastly, the students who I know well and represent a multitude of diverse groups seem to feel supported and especially value their close relationships to professors. Am I 100% morally aligned to upper admin and board? Absolutely not (is anyone though?). Anyway, encourage anyone reading to not be be scared off because of the comments above and at least check it out for yourself.

Only those data-sciency enough to parse the application instructions from the data will bee considered [link fixed, puns can stay - AP] 5) It is worth noting that the 87 - 92K salary, while competitive nationally, is very low for Boulder where the median home price is approaching $1 million. 6) Well, I was going to apply for what would be a great job at a fantastic school in an amazing location, but now that #5 has pointed out how lame the salary is, I guess I won't 7) yikes, apologies for the copy-paste error... thanks for fixing, AP 8) 5 Here again. @6 Not saying don't apply. It is a fantastic school, just pointing out that people should not expect to live nearby as it is a very expensive area (and CU Boulder tends to underpay professors). If seriously considering the position explore Longmont, Superior, Louisville, Lafayette, and the northwestern Denver suburbs. Be aware you will likely have to commute (I know that some are fine with that). Those areas are still expensive, but at leasy potentially within reach at that salary range. 8) I know someone at Boulder who has trouble (practically and ethically) recruiting grad students because it's so expensive to live there these days. Not that it will stop me from applying...  9) that's strange @8, because CU routinely punches above its weight in terms of grad recruitment bc of how nice a place Boulder is. This is a dream job folks - don't let anyone convince you otherwise 10) ""nice"" and ""expensive"" are two different metrics. Anyone can google average rent by # bedrooms vs average stipend and draw their own conclusions. 11) Boulder does have trouble recruiting top tier students because even a GRFP barely makes rent there.

[discussion of PD-to-TT positions moved to General Discussion -AP]  2) Is this position its own thing, or is the Geography department just urging people to pick them in a more-general program? 3) Looks like only certain departments get authorized to search for postdoc fellows in this program, geography being one of them (found info here https://cla.umn.edu/research-creative-work/presidents-postdoctoral-fellowship-program) 4) Faculty member at UMN here - the PPFP fellows are dept specific, so in this case Geography searching for one means that Geography gets their own pool of applicants and conducts their own search and hires independently of the rest of the departments who are also hiring via the PPFP this year. It's run very similar to a normal departmental faculty search since the intention is convert this person to a TT position.  5) at #4, so why the PD-TT program?  I do not see what advantage this has to simply advertising a PD and then later advertising a TT position?  Even the add says you will be considered for TT, not that you will be converted directly.  Those are two very different things that raise questions about the transparency of the position.  Please, do not take this as insult.  I am genuinely asking a hard question because it really does not make sense to me to take this approach. 4 @5) I'm just generally at UMN, not this dept, and I think the discussion of this type of position got moved to another tab, but in short - there are pros and cons to all kinds of hiring and its hard to know how likely the conversion step is without talking to the search committee. UMN uses this mechanism fairly often for recruiting people to the school that are extremely promising but need a bit more time to develop their identities as indepentent scholars without the pressures of everything else that TT entails (teaching, committees, grants, etc). 6) Just putting it out there that, although it varies a bit across departments and colleges, UMN doesn't have the greatest record of actually converting these positions to TT 7) oh interesting. did you find some data on the fellows outcomes?

This position is replacing faculty who have been there for decades, which is the case for most faculty (it's a place people tend to stay long-term). I'm not aware of a single professor who wasn't renewed in the 20 years since I matriculated. And as someone who came to COA from a school that did shut down, I can say that COA has an excellent endowment and is very financially stable. These are great questions to ask during an interview, but I hope they don't prevent people from applying to a really incredible place. Many SLACs don't have a typical tenure system, but are a lot of folks' dream jobs. 10) What does the leadership role in the museum refer to? management, curating collection, reserach lead? 11) What is the salary range?

I realize the university has a scant reputation outside of Quebec, but there's a strong ecology group here and in Montreal broadly. (6) #4, it's actually ""human health and/or animal biology context"". This position is a re-advertisement of a failed search from last year, the scope of the position has been expanded to include both health-related and organismal/ecology research. The associated research chair can be via CIHR (=health) or NSERC (=pure biology/ecology). If you work on animal microbiome ecology/evolution, please consider applying.

All applications welcome. 9) at #9, is the scope refreshed enough that if we didn't make a zoom interview its legitimately worth reapplying? 10) @9 Yes, all applications welcome.","20","Match, exact","Wake Forest University","NC",199847,"Winston-Salem","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: STEM-dominant","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Midsize","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,1442,957,34,266,0,2699,241271,3372,168,1709,0,0,30,4,30,4,266,957,1070,372,0,0,8495,9266,8789,8296.333333,5441,3348,5367,71,0,3,2683,665,1452,0,19,0,NA,NA,22,52,NA,752,0.278622,34,41,16,0.470588,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,17,4,3834,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11959,3825,0.319843,3

(1) Probably  2) Looks like rolling application consideration.  Not necessarily short. It would be helpful if an SC member could confirm. (3) wasnt there a similar job post a few years ago? Did that search fail? (4) Yes, that search failed. (5) SC member here. Evaluation of applications will actually begin OCTOBER 6--it took a bit longer than usual to get this posted becasue of new NY laws to post salary range.  6) Thanks SC! x3. 7) Shouldn't this new deadline be updated on the job posting? 8) already 3 applied dang it is going to be a popular one. anyone know about the salary? seems low for NYC but some bay area ones have discussion about the range not being a real range, same here? (8) Should the app be addressed to anyone in particular? 9) this was a listing last year for the same job IIRC. Also--I'll just say it here cuz I applied in the past, but they required a DEI statement but as far as I can tell nobody in their department has lifted a single finger on a DEI initiative--I searched the website for hours and found nothing. Makes writing this statement a huge burden. (10) To SC member - can you share any info about the SC's feeling towards pre-tenure assistant professors vs straight outta postdoc applicants, if there was any discussion about that? (11) @10 All schools like this will favor pre-tenure asst profs no matter what they say in response. (12) 10 here - not necessarily, they can be harder to convince to move depending on the situation 13) @10, I would guess Columbia is in a position both in prestige and location that they don't worry to much about having to convince applicants to move to them. (14) @11, can you share why you think a school like this would favor a pre-tenure asst prof over a postdoc? (15) I think they probably worry - area is expensive, crowded, and salary is potentially meh. someone with a TT spot in a smaller town might ask for a lot of resources (personal and professional) to make the jump. (16) For the statement about increasing diversity, has anyone focussed on B-diversity (eg differences in species numbers between populations) or just talking about alpha-diversity (species richness)? I submitted mine with only alpha but am worried I should have went broader (17) Anyone know who the search chair is? (11 again) @14, these schools have strong programs only because they have the funds to recruit people who have demonstrated success elsewhere. they don't take risks (18) does anyone know how distinct the E3 department is from the rest of the Biological Sciences department?

Vision statement = research statement. BI statement = DEI statement. Having 3 published papers to attach as reprints should be easy. Cover letter and CV are standard job packet components. x2 4) I like the vision statement (despite the cheesy name). The instructions are very clear about what that document should contain, moreso than for most research statements.x3 5) Have to agree. Sometimes the top tier schools are pretty agregious but this seems like a fancy way of describing the standard materials. 6) That vision statement request is pretty different from nearly every research statement I've read x2 7) I guess this answers the question from the Venting Tab, ""Who determines the standard?"" 8) Is this worth applying to for folks who study evolution? 9) In their last round, lots of people were notified as 'tier 1' applicants who then somehow were not interviewed - is there any point in re-applying, or does this mean that those folks simply did not meet the search criteria and should let it go? 10) How many is ""lots of people""? From the message I saw, it read as if there were only ~10.. 11) @9, if the last search had a different focus, worth reapplying. Also worth reaching out the SC if you made the long list but weren't called to see if you fit for this search. (like x1)  12) Is this worth applying if i dont have a CNS paper? 13) @12 tbh no, look at who got hired last time and make your decision that way. 14) CNS isn't required, but a previous stint at an Ivy, specifically Harvard, definitely helps. 15) It's an open rank position. They may be hiring someone with tenure, so I think it's reasonable for them to ask for a little more in the way of an application. 16) GREAT department. Lofty goals, but the support and community to enable it. 17) anyone know the geographic area? whats it like living there? 18) I was a grad student at Princeton and found it to be a really nice place to live. Lots of convenient amenities on Route 1, but also a lot of nice ruralish green space. ~1 hour from both Philadelphia and New York. Some faculty lived in Princeton proper, others a bit further away in other townships. Seems like a nice place to have a family, but students/postdocs/faculty who were more into big city settings found it a bit quiet. 18) close to the ocean too (45 mins). 19) For those interested, there will be a Q&A webinar hosted by the search committee on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, at 12 PM EDT - https://princeton.zoom.us/s/95659402367 no registration required. 20) @12 - I'd worry less about not having a CNS paper and more about not having a PhD from an Ivy League school. Just saying.  21) seems like I've seen different posts for this job.  Why does the job ad say eco-evo-behavior but social media and colleagues are saying behavior only?  That seems like a bait and switch if true and misleading by others if false.  Is there some political battle about which faction gets this search? @19 where was this zoom advertised? Is it definitely open to anyone? 22) the zoom is put on by the department/search committee. They did the same with their evolution post last year. It is open to anyone interested in applying 23) Am I reading this posting correctly that there is no teaching statement? 24) Curious as to what kind of information could this Q&A possibly contain? I'm not applying so won't attend, but am sincerely interested in what purpose this serves. I suspect to reassure everyone to drop their preconceived notions about what gets you hired there? 25) I think that the reason Universities started doing these webinars is to try to make the application process more accessible to diverse groups. 26) I see the application asks for contact info for references. Do we know if refs are contacted when we apply/if letters requested up front? 27) @26 and everyone, it was just stated during the webinar that letters ARE requested upfront by the Oct 25 deadline. 28) Letters can arrive past the deadline, as was stated towards the end of the webinar. The application with contact info for references has to be submitted by the deadline. 29) Was the Zoom recorded and will it be posted for those who couldn't attend? 30) To the best of my knowledge, the zoom Q&A was not recorded. 31) I was in the webinar, and it was definitely recorded (the little red recording indicator was in the corner of the screen).

We are seeking a physiologist that is able to teach our core physiology course which is Comparative Animal Physiology (lecture and lab), but the area of research is flexible as long as the candidate can develop upper division electives in their area of expertise. 4) Received a rejection email ""The position remains open until filled; however, at this point you have not been selected to interview.""","2","Match, partial","California State University-San Marcos","CA",366711,"San Marcos","Master's Colleges & Universities: Larger Programs","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Comprehensive programs","Four-year, full-time, inclusive, higher transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily nonresidential","Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Suburb Large","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","Yes",0,3949,403,0,0,0,4352,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,77,326,2282,1667,0,0,16053,16959,16367,14362.333333,15040,1327,12379,2637,2,22,979,348,2117,138,1782,605,NA,NA,21,45,NA,728,0.167279,32,19,13,0.40625,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,13,0,1547,2118,553,480,470,950,17,18,17.792961,15413,12241,0.7942,1

They're ""supposed to"", but it's not enforced in any practical sense. Apply if you want the job! 6) SC member here. We encourage applicants to read through the educational leadership criteria linked in the ad, and encourage applicants of all nationalities to apply. 7) Hi SC member. What's the salary range? 8) expected starting 12-mo salary is $105,000 8) why doesn'tt the 12-mo salary align with research-oriented assistant professors in the department? (9) @8, The position doesn't require a Ph.D., so the qualifications and training time are significantly less than the research-oriented assistant professors. 10) Strange answer @9 since your recent hires for AP Teaching have PhDs and you will likely offer the job to someone with a PhD. 11) SC member here again - @9 that isn't the logic here. Pay scales are very similar and Assistant Professor salaries in the department tend to rise quickly for members of both teaching and research streams. More on UBC faculty salaries can be found on the faculty association website: https://www.facultyassociation.ubc.ca/worklife/salaries/ (9 again) @SC member, to clarify, I was just noting that the salary might and should be lower for some candidates given the requirements for the job. Candidates without a PhD should have a lower starting salary than those with, just given the difference in training time. The high end is absolutely competitive with research stream professors, and this is great.

Winter temperatures in the -20s or -30s F are not at all uncommon. Summers are very buggy as well. But it's a beautiful area with lots of outdoor recreation opportunities in both summer and winter. The nice thing about the cold is that the snow actually sticks around and is beautiful, instead of immediately turning to brown slop. Also, the winters aren't as gray as they are on, say, the East Coast. Once you get past mid-January, it tends to be pretty sunny. 5) I lived in northern MN for a couple years and I miss it. It is one of the most gorgeous places in the country, Itasca being one of my favorites. The people are amazing. I seriously miss it and would highly suggest giving it a try for anyone on the fence. 6) I wonder if the pay range will be low. The position seems classified for a BS level. 4) Yeah, they're willing to take someone with a BS but prefer MS or PhD. Kind of a weird qualifications spread, so hard to say what the pay is. Though cost of living would be very low there. 7) I thought it was interesting there was a statement about temp housing for this position and did look up houses for sale/rent. From what I can see online are fairly few and far between, though I'm not from around there so any insight could help others... based on the prices of the homes though that may indicate a lower pay range due to lower COL 8) Yes, few houses are available up there. The population density is very low. It may be hard to find a house. 9) I lived up here for a couple years.  we had an amazing house on a modest salary.

Hoping to get a great colleague to join what, in my biased opinion, is an excellent department to work in. Will try to check in periodically to address questions. 2) Thank you, SC member! 3) What does this mean ""Application Materials will be reviewed by department faculty at the finalist stage of interviews."" ? 4) @3 It means that app materials (except letters) for finalists who interview on campus are shared with all dept faculty. Other apps remain internal to search comm. 5) phylogenetics is pretty broad, any insight as to what flavor of phylogenetics this position is excpected to fill? 6) Who is the search chair for this position? The contact given on the ad is in HR, what if we have questions about the scientific scope of the position, who can we contact? 7) From #1: @5 yes, definitely a broad area and the (non-exhaustive) list of example topics in the ad reflects the fact that we don't have a specific ""flavor"" in mind. Really are open to anyone with strong depth of experience in phylogenetic methods. Also, important that at least part of their research program addresses biological questions (at any level: molecular, cellular, organismal, etc). Someone with a purely computer science and algorithmic focus would probably not be a good fit. @6 Not 100% sure if HR wants us publicly disclosing SC members.

Will do! 9) Question for the SC member - would a research program that uses but doesn't develop phylogenetic methods be competitive? 10) @9 Yes, we are looking for a substantial depth of expertise in phylogenetic approaches, but that doesn't mean candidates necessarily have to be developing those methods. 11) thanks CSU for listing the salary range! 84-90K. 12) In case anyone's wondering, that salary range is for 9-month appt. Obviously higher with summer salary. 13) I submitted my application materials but would like to update them. I wasn't able to do that in the system. Is it still possible to do so? 14) @13 From SC member: I suspect so but not entirely sure how the system works. Get in touch with the search contact listed in the job posting. He would be the best admin contact. 15) It says 45% research, 45% teaching - how is teaching effort allocated?

We also have major gaps in ecology, evolution and marine, especially given our setting in the subtropics and methodological needs (e.g. we are looking for computational, theoretical, organismal AND field people). This place is amazing and you will be able to do the research of your dreams on mostly internal funding with guaranteed postdoc/staff scientist/tech and student lines and a full time adminstrator for your lab, the newest equipment with tech support, and a US R1 pay scale plus housing and childcare subsidies in a very low cost of living area (by Western and Japanese standards). We also go to great lengths to resolve two body problems both in academia and outside (many non-academic spouses are employed at OIST in various offices) and offer internal assistance for living in Japan (i. e. translation when contacting places, help finding resources and English-speaking doctors, free language classes, etc).

This is an honest question. I'm not trying to complain. 6) I'd say it may be tight on that salary, but possibly doable. A car is an absolute necessity though. (7) @3 the college sponsors visas for foreign nationals. 8) @5 As someone who grew up in the area and still has family/friends there, I'd say the salary is grossly insufficient. I have friends who make $150k+ who are struggling to find affordable housing. Sorry, I'm not trying to be discouraging, but I just wanted to share. 9) @8 is correct, this salary range is absolutely not enough for SoCal where rent is ~ $3k a month for apartment. Single family earner? Would need a 2nd job...10) it looks like those numbers weren't adjusted for recent pay increases (they match the 2016-2020 hires).

(not to say those numbers are enough either...but it's a CSU...) 11) Also something to take note of is that their two most-recent marine hires have left/are leaving and a couple other folks have retired/partially retired...so the current marine faculty are more like 2, not the 7 the website shows... 12) any word yet? 13) @12 none here (10/2) 13) Invited for zoom interview 10/9 x6 14) darn it...but congrats to those who got zoom interviews x2","12","Match, by alias","California State University-Northridge","CA",110608,"Northridge","Master's Colleges & Universities: Larger Programs","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Single program-Education","Four-year, full-time, inclusive, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily nonresidential","Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Large","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes",0,9262,1575,10,30,0,10877,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,10,464,1141,4220,5042,0,0,39910,42736,40381,34722.333333,34916,5465,29187,5694,4,31,2702,2763,3967,49,5257,1502,NA,NA,25,52,NA,1986,0.182587,55,64,37,0.672727,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,23,1,3443,3821,665,460,440,900,16,17,16.851761,27765,18271,0.658059,1

SC member: This search is broad, but we are particulary interested in people doing research in phylogenomics, evolutionary genomics, and/or disease ecology. Ideal candidates could teach genomics / computational bio and biostats courses. This application does NOT require letters of reference up front, just contact information. 2) It says no letters required upfront, but when you are applying it says 3 are required as part of the application. Perhaps a mistake from their HR? @2) Thanks for highlighting this...it should be fixed now 3) Can somebody (SC) speak to this being a Jesuit institution ""still influenced by Jesuit teachings"", and to what extent that does or does not impact faculty studying evolution, etc.? 4) SC member here: Fordham is no longer officially run by the Jesuits, so they say they are in the ""Jesuit tradition"". There are classes and programs in Jesuit philosophy / theology available for undergraduates, and a fellowship available for women in the sciences at Catholic colleges (Clare Booth Luce; many of our PhD students have this fellowship and don't teach for a few years. You don't have to be Catholic to get it). There are some Jesuit brothers living on campus, and a few still teaching. But day to day Fordham's Jesuit affiliation has zero impact on faculty outside of theology or other narrow programs (and Jesuits do not deny evolution FWIW). The mission statement of the university says something about the university being for people of all faiths and no faith. The new president of Fordham is the first non-Jesuit to hold that post (and the first woman). 5)Just want to chim in that I did my undergraduate degree in biochemistry at a different Jesuit institution and my intro biology professor was a Jesuit- I literally learned evolution from a priest. Jesuit education is about educating the whole person and definitely not anti-science. 4) SC member again: in response to a request: the teaching load in this department is 2.5 courses / year (1 / 1.5). Half of a lecture course or one lab section counts as 0.5 courses. A lecture course that meets 2x / week for 1.25 hours each session typically counts as 1 course towards the load. We have both undergraduate and graduate courses. 7) Did they add more questions from HR recently? I've submitted my application but now it is saying it is incomplete as two required questions were not answered, but I don't know how that's possible when you can't submit it without answering them all? There is no option to edit, can the SC member ask HR to enable editing?","3","Match, exact","Fordham University","NY",191241,"Bronx","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Not Classified","Mid East DE DC MD NJ NY PA","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,2544,2669,112,401,0,5726,5472,14984,5,576,9,11,8,84,28,84,473,2597,1706,838,0,0,16972,19139,16364,14042.666667,9399,6965,8838,261,49,251,3995,2970,2071,15,240,10,NA,NA,23,52,NA,1291,0.225463,50,79,19,0.38,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,18,10,4842,1498,693,620,610,1230,27,25,25.632588,47936,25180,0.525284,3

Search failed last year. (2) Any insight into why it failed or what they might be looking for; i.e., what we might emphasize--if we have it--in our apps? (3) why do searches fail when so many people are desperate for jobs? (4) the search last year failed because the person that was offered the job accepted another position  5) Person, Singular?  Only one person worth employing?  This institution usually gets lots of applicants. 6) @5 its more common than you think. They probably wanted that person specifically and didn't even look at other apps 7) @3 you're essentially hiring a colleague for life. sometimes a search doesn't bring in anyone that the faculty feels is the right fit. depending on the nature of the funding for the position, they'll often cut bait and wait until the following year or even later in the hope of generating a different applicant pool.  (8) my understanding is that it failed because of dysfunctional department politics. this department is notorious for that (see discussion in General Discussion and in Venting this year and last). What I heard is some search committee members didn't even schedule meetings with non-offered candidates. This department also has a history of interviewing nationals from the developing world to fill out diversity quotas but categorically will not offer to them. Very likely most of the interviewed candidates weren't given serious consideration.  9) Search members not meeting candidates and not seeing talks would be an HR violation at my school that could pull the search completely.  Seems rude to candidates as well.  Past searches have not handled COIs well.  It makes me think this school does not value fair hiring practices if they let those practices continue.  It's a shame because it is such a great school. (10) @7 -- when you get well-over triple-digit apps, if you can't find a ""colleague for life"" it is perhaps because the faculty is not willing to expand their view of their ideal colleague. x2 (11) maybe this is a department that needs to clear house after a few big name people retire. x3 (12) This is one salty, bitter job board; I thought gossip and venting were reserved for other pages? x6  13) @12, seems like a lot of useful information to me. (14) useful but take it with many grains of salt x2 [personal attack deleted, while I ponder how to clean up the rest of this borderline appropriate discussion -AP] (15) Please don't let this unfounded speculation discourage you from applying. In my experience it's quite an amazing environment for new faculty! x5 16) @15, if you are one of the people who makes it past the interview issues, then I'm sure it is.  That doesn't mean they did right by all candidates on their past searches.  x3 (17) I'm in this dept as postdoc and have no idea why people here are so negative. This place rules, and everyone should apply for this job. x2 (18) previous postdoc with one of the 'bigwigs' - not a great Dept. 19) Good dept or not, good luck living in Vancouver on this salary - unless your partner happens to make the same or preferably much, much more. @19, what is the salary, I don't see it in the ad? (20) expect between 110-145 depending on experience (12 month), is my best guess. (21) The university provides faculty housing (22) @18 why is the dept ""not great""? Are you talking about Zoology? Everyone I know who's either worked or studied there is fantastic and has loved it aside from the usual gripes about vancouver housing. Super collegial, collaborative and interdisciplinary department with a strong sense of community among students and faculty. 23) @18 and @22, the word you're looking for is ""quaint"" 24) seems like people's experiences of UBC depend on whether specific faculty members believe their research qualifies as ""evolutionary biology."" 25) as a pdoc in the dept, my impression is that the search failed last year because they were looking for someone to fill the macroevolution methods void that was recently created, but the department could use some younger faculty and I speculate their search this year so as to avoid another delay in hiring such a person - p.s. the dept is great. (26) Definitely being macro/methods is an advantage, but the person they offered to last year does not fit this mold! (27). Getting ready to submit an app.....aaand letters due by the 1st....

Because it is only open for 10 days and it is not posted anywhere other than the career website of the school. 1) Ugh I was excited about this until I read this 2) People complain about Universities not offering their VAPs tenure-track position, and they complain when they do, but you can't complain about both. If it is an internal hire, good for that VAP I'm sure it is making their dream come true and I'm glad that they won't be stuck in VAP limbo watching their career dwindle. If you are interested, throw your app at it and move on. +2 (3) totally agree. It's actually heartening to see a VAP--who has already given to the school--be recognized as a good colleague with the promise of a long career. No need to butt them out with ""the latest and greatest shiny new thing"" when a great candidate is right there. Normalize steady careers and locations! 4) @2 & 3, I don't think the complaint is about them hiring the VAP, but about lots of other good candidates applying, thinking they have a chance, even interviewing. I have gone on three on campus interviews where an internal candidate was ultimately hired. I spent so much time prepping and traveling for those, and I just wish they had promoted the internal candidate without a national search (yes, this is possible at some places). At least this one seems very obvious and gives a super short turnaround so maybe it won't waste too many people's time. 5) Agree with 4. I'm not annoyed with a VAP being hired for a permanent position--that should be normalized! I'm annoyed that institutions still run a national search for internal promotions of that nature, which takes up other people's time and energy. That also happened to me last season. Doing all of the prep and practice for an on campus interview ate up a lot of my time and it was all for naught. 6) anyone hear anything? 7) Confirmed will be internal hire","2","Match, exact","Middlebury College","VT",230959,"Middlebury","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences focus, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Single program-Other","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, small, highly residential","Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Town Distant","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,839,192,5,0,0,1036,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,0,177,15,774,65,0,0,2657,4616,2669,2591,2580,89,2551,20,1,8,0,89,602,0,5,0,NA,NA,17,45,NA,266,0.256757,38,11,5,0.131579,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,3,1,2556,383,262,670,670,1340,31,28,29.218605,9174,2022,0.220405,3

Beautiful area though 4) I am a current faculty member at Southern Oregon University (SOU), but I am not affiliated with this search: Indeed, SOU is a small, regional, public university with a high teaching load (~12 contact hours per term) and low research expectations (~1 paper required for tenure). Like many regional universities, SOU has struggled financially (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2023/03/22/president-proposes-steep-job-cuts-save-his-institution), but I (and I think many other faculty members) are optimistic about the future. This position could be a great fit for an environmental scientist who would enjoy teaching during the school year and mentoring students through research during the summer. Here is some more information about SOU and faculty life there: a) Faculty salaries increase 2-3% every year based on explicit salary tables outlined in the collective bargaining agreement; b) Many faculty enjoy comfortable lives in Ashland at the current salaries, but the cost of housing makes buying a home difficult for new faculty. Being a dual-income household helps, of course; c) Many faculty still own homes in Ashland and surrounding cities; d) Ashland, OR is an amazing place to live and do research, especially for environmental scientists and ecologists; and e) The administration is actively growing environmental degree programs and research programs. If you are an environmental scientist who loves teaching and wants to live in a vibrant small town with near-perfect weather, amazing restaurants, abundant public lands, and world-class theater, then you should consider SOU. 5) This isn't an ecology or evolution listing though 6) @5 The ad specifically mentions soil science and ecohydrology. Seems germane to this board. 7) Yeah, it's not much of a leap from soil ecology or biogeochemistry to this stuff. 8) I appreciate the SOU context-- thanks @4!  8) These vacancies can be filled by anyone with an aquatics background.  ECOHYDROLOGY and SOIL ECOLOGY are pretty clearly ECOLOGY! 10) Man, the ecoevo gatekeepers are riled up this cycle... 11) I am advocating for a statement of erring on the side of inclusivity for job postings. This is a board to help people and having more postings is more helpful. Having to scroll past a few lines that don't apply to you doesn't hurt anything. (x7) 12) in support of #11, if you are truly an EVS graduate, you should be able to teach some soils.  If you can't, your degree is really something else.  The USEPA defined an EVS PHD as someone with a multidisiplinary degree drawing from Social, natural, and physical sciences.  The recommended background was courses in env. policy/law, environmental biology, environmental chemistry/geology, and later, env. sociology was added.  this was published many years ago in Science.  However, most programs are poor-man's ecology or chemistry programs with little real interdisciplinary nature.  An EVS person should have an emphasis in one of the four areas.  But, they should have no problem teaching a few freshman courses in any of the other fields.

Evolutionary biologists who use molecular and cellular tools are encouraged to apply. Great place to work in a growing department with new building, new greenhouse, and more hires anticipated.  Starting salary range $90-98.5K.  2) sounds great - any chance of associate-level hiring (unlikely I'm sure, but thought I'd ask). 3). The position has only been approved at the assistant level, but we would be interested in advanced assistants with credit towards tenure.  Unlikely that associate-level hire would be approved, but very manageable tenure expectations 4) What's teaching load like here?  5) I believe the teaching load is 13.5 credits a year.  One example of how this roughly works is to teach ~2 sections of a (often the same) course one semester (6 credits; e.g., 2 sections of intro bio) and an upper division lab that you would prep the second semester (e.g., lecture + lab for the same course; ~7 credits).   Every few years you may need to take on an extra section of a pre-prepped lab to make up that extra half credit. 6) Curious, given there are already 4-5 VAP in this department, what chances do external candidates realistically have? 7) Excellent chances for outside candidates.  While occasionally, visitors have been hired for open tenure lines, it is the exception and not the rule.

Yuck. What a waste of everyone's time. x2 (2) agree with 1 and not applying if letters required up front. X8 3) A huge ""BOOOOOO!"" to this SC. (4) legit not trolling here, but is asking for letters up front really that big of a deal? Don't most people's references have stock letters more or less put together at this point in their careers? Is this really a deal breaker? Isn't something like a 4 page tailored research statement more demanding? 6) Yes, no, yes, some of us care about other people's time besides our own (4) @6, no need to get snippy. I was just curious why this point is a deal breaker for some when other parts of the research package take much more time and effort to prepare (like a 4 vs 2 page research proposal) but aren't a deal breaker. Many people's references have letters ready from previous apps, and it doesn't take much time to tweak on their end. I actually do care about other people's time as well. Thanks for your mature and respectful response though. (7) if you fit the job description, apply. Your letter writers will not mind, trust me (from a letter writer). Best advice is to apply to as many jobs as you can, if you want a succesful job season. Not applying because of letters unneccesarily reduces your chances of an interview in a given year. x4. (8) I suggest not to post an irrelevant argument that does not help people in looking for a summarized description of useful items from the position. (9) fun fact for the ""upfront letters are gross"" crowd: your writers may get more advanced notice and prefer it that way! I usually know I'm applying 4-6 weeks ahead of time and give them notice, but when I've been invited for interviews they're usually given ~2 weeks to get their letters in. x2 (9) the entitlement and self-importance of the position of the folks who claim they don't apply for a job with letters up front is galling.

(1) potentially replacing a prof who moved to UCSC last yr; worked on evolutionary adaptation to extreme environments using genomics.  (2) Are they looking for someone similar? That is my field... (3) Like 2, also interested in whether the focus will be on evolution. Would ecological research be applicable? (4) I suspect that, like most searches, they have a broad vision and probably some specific thing they're looking for that only will become apparent after everyone's applied! Just shoot your shot if you have materials. 5) Faculty member in department here - this is meant to be a broad search for people who integrate among subdisciplines in biology. We are looking for someone with strong quantitative skills. 6) @5 is there ever a faculty search where they're looking for someone with mediocre quantitative skills? 7) @4 second faculty member here. There isn't anything specific behind the scenes, we're open to a wide range of disciplines as we hope this is the first of several hires. (8) Thanks for the info, faculty members! 9) @6, isn't that the majority of faculty hires? 10. what's with the snarkiness?  not a faculty member! 🤣 10) guess this is not for someone international, right? it says at the end WSU only hires US citizens & lawful authorized people. 11) I second that question. Are non-citizens who can get a visa welcome to apply? 12) yes international applicants welcome and encouraged. 13) Once a non-American citizen accepts a job at a US university, the Uni will sponsor them for a visa, and they will be a lawful authorized worker. Go ahead and apply! 14) what 13 said is typically quite true, but note that there is no guarantee a school will want to sponsor a visa, especially smaller schools. Just piping up to say that sponsorship is certainly common but not a ""given"". 15) Just to be extra clear to those who asked, WSU is not a ""smaller school"" 15) I interviewed here last year and had an awesome experience. I ended up taking a position elsewhere that was a better fit- but the folks were super nice the town(s) adorable (great food, cool farmers market), and the grad students were top tier. For folks who fit the very broad posting, don't pass this one up. I really enjoyed my time interacting with the community here. 16) search chair is Wes Dowd 17) Does this position only asks for a CV first? I see no option in the system to upload the other documents. 18) The ad says ""External candidates, please upload all documents in the “Resume/CV” section of your application."" 19) a second position was just added to this posting, with a deadline of October 15 20) Thanks WSU for listing salary range! 85-90k for assist, 90-95k for assoc 21) pay attention to the word ""potential"" for the second position. Your best bet is to apply before the first deadline of 9/20 to automatically be considered for both. 22)Logged into account at 9:00 AM from europe and it was not available. I read that the deadline was 11:59 on September 20, but the link to both jobs is dead? Is this an error or did it close on the 19th? 23) @22 it looks closed for me too. 24) @22,23 Same here. I've emailed the SC chair about the issue. 25) I submitted my application last night but received no confirmation email that it submitted OK, so I went to double check the ad this morning to email SC but the job also seems to have disappeared. Did others who applied get confirmation emails of submission? 26) I never received a confirmation email, but the application dashboard says ""Application Received"" 27) Search chair here: There was a HR issue with the application site but the posting is now available again so please try to apply before tonight's deadline. Apologies for the confusion. Also, I do not believe that Workday issues a confirmation email when applications are submitted. Thanks. 28) Thank you SC-I came here to ask about workday confirmation! 29) ""The max number of files that can be uploaded is '5'"". They asked us for 7 documents. Not a big deal, but wanted others to know. 29) Yeah, anyone struggling with upload? My file is WAY over size limits... 30) Yeah 5MB for that number of files is really hard. I wasn't able to compress one of my reprints enough - couldn't get it under 9MB for that one file! So I included a link to it in my cover letter and explained the file size issue. Hopefully that's okay! 31) I ended up submitting multiple files cause of the limit. One of my reprints alone was nearly at the limit, even compressed. 32) Received a confirmation email from workday this morning (applied yesterday). x3 33) Very strange-I didn't receive any confirmation from workday (site for internal candidates)-I wonder why the discrepency? 34) I am so used to workday pooping out that my advice is to not sweat it. 35) @34 lol yes 36) Any word yet? 37) Nope. It's still very earl. Only 12 days total since it closed; 8 workdays if the search committee takes weekends off. 38) Anyone heard anything? 39) @38 Nope x8 40) Zoom interview invites sent today. x 2 41) For both positions or just the initial one? 42) unclear from the email I recieved. 43) SC, out of curiosity, how many applications did you receive for this position? 44) several hundred, and the second round of review has not begun. 45) For those of you that received an invite-what do you work on? 46) You guys forgot to send me my invitation x3 47) @45, invert and vertebrate. evo genomics and physiology mostly. (48) @SC, what does it mean that second round of review has not begun? Also, seems strange to do zoom interviews but not letter requests? 49) not SC, but can say that zoom invites also included a request for letters. 50) I assume ""second round of review"" refers to the second hire they're likely making for the position, which had a review date of 10/15, but it's not clear how they'll review applicants for the 2nd position. 51) Can people who got invites this round share their career stage? 52) @ 45, same research topic as @47 for me.

(email to EEB and do the official September 16 deadline). (2) The LSA Collegiate Fellows Program was designed to enhance diversity amongst postdocs and ECRs transitioning into faculty positions - maybe fair to assume the same is true for any associate level hires. (3) @2 The Sept 8th deadline is for other departments, not EEB (""For candidates for the following departments: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology[...]: Monday, October 16, 2023"", but the department asks to send materials directly to them by Sept 16) (4) Folks should be fully aware that these are DEI jobs and therefore adjust your effort and expectations accordingly. (5) Does this mean URMs are encouraged to apply? (6) it is not a ""DEI job"" it is a standard tenure track job in the EEB dept. URMs and those with exceptional DEI track records are especially encouraged to apply. x4 (7) Am I reading the ad correctly - could someone who is a new assistant prof at another university apply? (8) re: (7) yes that's correct x3 (4) @6 that is a very disingenuous statement. look at who has recieved these positions in the past—I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this and I strongly support these sorts of initatives, but certain people should know that they're very unlikely to be considered for the position. (9) Could someone who is in the middle of tenure-track (e.g., 2-4 year into the tenure track but not ready for promotion yet) apply? (6) re: (9) yes! 10) Yeah @4. I've just looked at the full list of awards through this program from the last 5 years and it is pretty clear that I should not waste my time. 11) Where does it say to email EEB by Sept 16?

(14) I had the worst interview experience of my life in this dept. Caveat emptor. (15) Do you have any ideas about how they will match the tenure-track systems of different countries, as the systems (time, terminologies) in many countries will differ from the USA? (16) Could someone please explain what is a writing sample? -> Published works (2-3 works; 35 pages maximum per writing sample). This is the first time I see this document. (17) I believe that is copies of your best publications. (18) !!Elligibility criteria  - PhD earned between 2019 and 2024!! 19) @18 this is true but only for the Collegiate Fellowship, not for the Senior Collegiate Fellowship. 20) Gosh, it is the second time I see a position at UM and it is always such a mess re: submission of application material, letters etc. It is always so confusing. I'd suggest UM to review these and make it easier for everyone. Personally, this confusion and having to submitt the letters in advance are the reason I am not applying. 21) The application link is not working for me. 22) The entire network was down for about 3 days at UMich. The link should be working now. And this search is not a mess. it is a program run through the college. You submit your materials to EEB for feedback to improve your application. Then you submit to the college at the later deadline. Reach out to the department if you have questions or are confused. 23) @14 would you mind elaborating, still thank you if not.  24) Can we still apply if we missed EEB's Sept. 16th deadline? x2 25) @24 yes! I asked them a while ago about this. Get your materials to the department asap though. The Sept deadline was ""soft"" so they could help improve materials from suitable candidates. 26) @25 Does this mean they will tell applicants whether they are ""suitable"" before the October deadline? x6 27) @14 what was so bad about it? just curious about what to be aware of. 28) Has anyone heard anything? x6 29) Virtual interviews happening this week. 25) @26, I suppose so. I don't really know for sure. It's just what I was told when I inquired. I didn't end up applying though. 30) @29 This week is over.. is there a point in applying on 10/16 if we weren't contacted? 31) @30 I am not on the committee, but I would suspect not because that application (due in Oct) would not go through EEB, it would go to another entity who decides on who is hired. So, if one is not approved or considered by the department first, I don't think there would be much of a chance in that second hiring round. 32) This feels pretty awkward. Will they reply to our application to tell us not to apply? Wondering if I should tell my letter writers not to bother. x10 33) Radio silence here too. Well, at this point, I won't even bother applying, especially since reference letters are due by the 16th. 34) Rejection letter--didn't get a Zoom invite x11 35) Rejection letter - after zoom interview. x3 (35) Was the interview with EEB or with the DEI Fellow program?

Typically you will need a high impact factor paper. it's also very challenging for women to get selected and they are often very senior when they are, though this is changing in some places. (4) Interesting, it seems like most of the junior hires recently have been women in EEB (5) I'm not sure #3 is correct, there's been a big push to hire more women in most universities in Switzerland. I cannot say how effective it has been though. (6) To #1: it is highly variable and does not necessarily rely on high impact papers. Also depends on university, Geneva is not very prominent or well-funded. (7) Would they appoint a senior person on a non- or reduced) tenure track position? (8) @7 this is pure speculation, but based on my experience as a postdoc in Switzerland, they are not averse to hiring senior folks.

In my experience, most science depts have many international profs, and most courses are taught in English. 10) I loathe with a passion these positions that put a time limit on how far out your phd is. It is ludicrous. Do I have to list all the BS I went through as a postdoc to get an extension? The sexual harassment? The miscarriages? The antagonistic postdoc advisor?

(11) I'm sorry this all happened to you, but I do think any request for extension within reason would be accepted by committee (10 again) Thanks 11. I appreciate that. Perhaps you're right about an extension. I also just hate this strategy - it just rewards folks who had it easy, not necessarily people who are inherently more talented or productive (for the most part).

I think this is a great position for someone who is entirely focused on research and has no interest in teaching or outreach. You can build your own research program, but institutional support is more limited than what you would generally find at a traditional academic institution. There is a lot of pressure to bring in large federal grants, but if you feel confident in your ability to do so, it can be an excellent opportunity for the correct person. 4). I'm a scientist at Cary. Salary is competetive with top notch institutions. It is a hard money position with a community goal of recovering a portion of salary. Feel free to reach out to the search committee with any questions. Many many opportunities for outreach and teaching if interested. Communitity is caring and egaged. 5) I was also a field tech at Cary and I disagree with the statement that this is a position for someone who ""has no interest in outreach or teaching"". Not being a University does mean there is less teaching, but there are still plenty of opportunities to teach if the scientist is interested. Also, the amount of outreach Cary scientists do is often more than a tradition academic position due to the time release of not having consistent teaching requirements. 6) @4 I am curious about the faciltites at the institute, is there any opportunity to chat with someone before hand? I could not find information about labs and othr facilties on the webpage. 4) @6. The search committee is listed on the ad and enthusiastic to speak to folks. reach out to ask about facilities and what you would need to do great science! 5? 7) can anyone speak to the housing market there? It looks like there aren't many houses under $400k based on a quick search 8) Given what (7) had discussed, anyone know if a remote position would be considered? 9) Theres places well below that price 25 min away in Poughkeepsie. 10) @8 This is one of the premier field research oriented institutes in the States. How would one run a program virtually? AP) Review date corrected. 11) @10 Nothing in the ad suggests they are only considering field researchers. It is absolutely possible to be an ecological scientist without conducting field work. I have the same question as @8 regarding the openess to remote work. 12) The way the salary is written in the ad as an ""annualized basis"" is not clear. Could be so many ways to interpret that 13) I interpret annualized basis as per year 14) In HR lingo ""annualized basis"" is total compensation provided to an employee in a year. So I agree it is not necessarily just salary they are including. Do they pull typical academic no summer salary shenanigans here? 15) It is a 12 month salary. This is a non-profit, if you are interested in seeing some of the staff's salaries, tax records are publically available. 16) is it too late to send in now? 17) If you still can-then I would 18) That's a heck of a lot of applicants!! 19) It's for more than one position though, so apps per position maybe are a regular ratio (whatever that is). 18) any updates? 20) doubt they have even starting sorting through the applications yet. 21) Chill out folks. All these positions with people asking for updates 1 or 2 weeks after closing is crazy x3 22) Yeah, unless the ad promises a tight schedule (e.g., ""we will conduct Zoom interviews in mid-October"" for a 10/1 deadline), it's silly to be wondering about updates not even 2 weeks in","26","Unmatched",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This took 1-2 months. 2nd-highest canidate was offered the job, turned it down because they are a postdoc and want to remain fully research-focused - this one does need a new Msc-level module. **I would strongly encourage past applicants to apply** - when there are are 50+ candidates, half of them are typically excellent... so the shortlisting process isn't random but its hard for it to be great - but one shouldn't interpret not being shortlisted as a rejection. 4) Recently my university hosted a researcher working at the School of Biological & Behavioural Sciences working in this particular field and in an informal conversation sHe expressed a very good impression of the departmentand and working conditions. We all know too well that universities positions not usually represent those of the departments and groups within. 5) Contrary to popular belief, the top candidate for the job did not negotiate a better position at their home university.

I'd apply if it got me a tour of the former rocket launch room. 5) The field of research is properly called ""Astrobiology"". ""Space Biology"" makes it seem like they're looking for a GIS tech. x2  6) Seriously, check out NASA's Exobiology program. There are a lot of opportunities for contemporary ecology, but it's not on a lot of folks' radar. 7) there are some pretty solid people in this dept, but also issues...as for the loose boundary between Exobiology (formerly Astrobiology) and Space Biology, NASA re-structured its funding divisions and moved human related research (Space Biology) into the general science funding pool, with the increased push for manned missions and the effects on humans (ionizing radiation is a biggy in this field) the center of Space Biology is shifting to microbial research and away from animal models...but that could change again.

So he probably won't apply.  It's really unfortunate for a department that should recruit well otherwise. 9) I have a feeling at @7 is not a field biologist.

I think we know, but that is kind of vague really. 4) @3 I'm not associated with the department, I just looked at the prior ads e.g. the organismal bio job on line 1135 and the integrative bio one on last year's list.   In response (I am affiliated with the marine science program at St. Mary's College of Maryland) The marine science department is new, first recruited class started FA22, Fall 23 we are looking at more than doubling enrollment. We are increasing faculty & resources to keep up with increasing enrollment. Marine Science has only had one search. It was successful. More info about staffing is on our website. All the statements about previous cluster hires and other organismal and integrative bio hires is not from the marine science deparment.

See the line about ""off-scale salaries"" 5) dept member here, @2 that search failed, an offer was made but the person went elsewhere, so we are re-running the search. @5, I can confirm that salaries for those recently hired are very much on the upper end of the quoted range. 6) how soon after review date would you prefer letters turned in? 7) @6 Search committee member here - ASAP on the letters please, 8) any news? x4 9) WE WANT NEWS x5 10) it's been over six weeks, so I'm guessing they already conducted or at least sent out requests form Zoom interviews? 10) @9 not me. 11) I wouldn't count this out if no one here has reported an update.
