In other words, you don't have to be a URM 3) what's a specific example of DEI expertise? 4) @ 3 Working with students from underrepresented groups. 5) @ 3 leading/creating DEI initiatives at the college-level, participating in local and national organizations dedicated to these areas, etc. 6) @4 no that doesn't count in DEI rubrics, and @5 its a pretty big ask to require leading/creating a DEI intiative for an early career researcher with no money behind them 7) @6 is right and so that leaves ""participation"", which is hardly DEI expertise if we're being honest 8) great, let's get back to making research the priority in hiring. x5 9) @3 just ask chatgpt, which is what everyone who applies for this job will do. 10) Didn't they run this search last year?

I am very happy in the department and find it to be very supportive, collegial, and collaborative. The building is on main campus, but on the far edge. With a bike and some effort, you can connect with other departments.

This call is for two open positions in a departmental hiring initiative themed 'Technology for Resilient Futures'. Candidates who take a holistic problem-solving approach in their research are encouraged to apply. 2) Any indication of salary range? 1) You can get a good indication of the pay-scale from searching openpayrolls.com for others in the department (School of Integrated Sciences). 3) @ SC member...Can you clarify what ""technology for resilient futures"" means?  My work has a lot of themes around climate and sustainability, but I have no idea what that phrase means.  Second, what is the teaching load here, and how fired up is the university about it's trajectory up the Carnegie Classification scale? 1) again. I'll answer @3 best I can: Regarding ""technology for resilient futures"", this search theme was supplied by a pay-grade above my own, but what I would suggest to applicants is to consider whether/how your scholarship seeks to understand or enhance the resilience of the system you study. This could include the context of ecological thresholds and resilience, but isn't limited to that context. Further, what technologies (broadly defined) do you use - or focus on - in your work on resilience? The standard teaching load is 3-3, and we have high teacher:student ratios on average. Regarding the Carnegie classification - some here are certainly excited about our new R2 status. It's too early to tell what, if anything, it will mean for faculty. 3) Not to sound stupid, but when I read ""technology for resilient futures"" I think about someone making beads that capture carbon or something like that.  I am guessing based on your description that that is not the entire scope of the call. 1) again. We are an interdisciplinary department and we hope to see applicants thinking creatively about how their backgrounds make them a good fit for these positions.","","Match, exact","James Madison University","VA",232423,"Harrisonburg","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Professional-dominant","Four-year, full-time, selective, lower transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Small","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,4873,792,35,5,0,5705,6169,4078,2,906,0,0,3,32,3,29,116,681,2643,2230,0,0,21820,24039,21594,20207.333333,19727,1867,18400,1150,20,157,1094,773,4479,26,606,87,NA,NA,22,51,NA,1042,0.182647,46,33,18,0.391304,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,13,4,6667,2519,642,570,550,1120,23,22,22.2031,23922,19255,0.804908,2

The job ad is very broadly written it could include an evolutionary biologist.  Rowan is a great place to work.  Great colleagues, competitive salaries.  1) what is the typical teaching load at Rowan for a TT professor with a research allocation? 2) Are plant people also welcome to apply? 3) they want unofficial transcripts so make sure you've got that process started if you are applying. 4) Undergrad at Rowan here, Rowan is at the suburban-rural interface and moving here was a pretty damn difficult adjustment as I lived right next to urban areas my whole life. IT WILL PROBABLY NOT BE AS HARD FOR YOU because I cannot drive and Philly is only 30 minutes away by car. I started to like it eventually (and quite a lot too, it's my favorite place I've ever lived because of this) because the natural beauty of south jersey is completely unmatched. Pine barrens is right there so you really have the best of both worlds with both rural and urban stuff. I think that both people who prefer rural life and urban life could live here happily, though I know some professors who have mainly lived previously in urban areas who don't like the location that much. It's not all of them or even most of them but keep that in mind. Also keep in mind the atmosphere for Queer people in this part of South Jersey is slightly uncomfortable, but I've only dealt with stuff being shouted at me from cars once in a blue moon and never have felt like I was in any physical danger (nor do I know anybody who has). The culture for Queer people AT THE UNIVERSITY is completely accepting I'm very gender non-conforming and all of the professors are completely chill with it. And the queer scene in close-by Philadelphia is the best in any city I've lived in, so in my opinon the pros substainally outweigh the cons in regards to this issue. I'm willing to answer any questions about life here though take it all with a grain of salt because of the aforementioned fact I'm an undegrad and life will obviously be a fair bit different as a professor here. but tldr; I genuinely like it here a lot, specifically the area even though at first I didn't think I would have  AP) There are undergrads who visit this site?! x3  OP again)  @#1: typical teaching load for research-active faculty is 1 lec + 1 lab/semester.  Can get lower if negotiated at time of hire or if you have grant $ to buy out.  @#2: YES plant folks are encouraged to apply.  Spin your app. towards human impacts and you'll have a better chance.  @#4: thanks for your input and viewpoint.  Many of the faculty here choose to live in Philly city center or the suburbs in PA and commute across the river.  Others choose to live in the pine barrens or the farm land (we're in peach country here).  Urban/suburban/rural areas are all within an easy commute. I bought a house in Glassboro and find it a very nice place to live.  @#4:  I'm glad you feel accepted and welcome. The department and university are serious about supporting and advocating for all. 5) @OP - if one's research is mainly environmental but uses computational approaches, would that possibly fit here, or better to deal directly with human [disease,health] impacts?   OP here, @5)  Human health impacts is a strength of the University.  We have 2 medical schools, a Vet school, and a School of Translational Biomedical Engineering.  Whereas this position is in the College of Science & Mathematics, we are looking for folks who will bridge collaborations with some of those units.  Spin your application in this direction and you'll likely get farther in the search process.  I hope that answers your question.

The successful candidate will additionally assume a service role as Director of the SDSU Coastal and Marine Institute (CMI) and its laboratory to help lead the growth of this institute as a center of excellence in marine research. This service position includes a reduction in teaching responsibilities during the academic year to provide time to fulfill the role of the CMI director."" 2) Does the pay seem low for San Diego and the Assoc prof level? 3) I thought so, even if you extrapolate out to 12 months, esp considering its a directorship 4) Is this a failed search from last year? 5) @2, 3 what field do you think you work in, exactly? 160K for Assoc Professor is completely reasonable, particularly because your 3 summer months are guaranteed due to admin duties. Sure, California is expensive, but if you can't make it work then don't apply? It's certainly not an insulting number. 6) The salaries are set by the CSU + COL increases. The director position doesn't really give an increase in salary during the academic year, it just reduces the teaching/service load. But it does give additional salary during the summer. This is fairly typical for how these positions work at other CSU's as well (at leaast the ones I have experience with, including SDSU).","","Match, exact","San Diego State University","CA",122409,"San Diego","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Professional-dominant","Four-year, full-time, selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily nonresidential","Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Large","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No",0,8185,1646,106,37,0,9974,78865,18845,23,758,8,0,30,68,38,68,588,1095,3551,4634,0,0,35544,38336,36334,32877.333333,31491,4843,28081,3212,3,195,3065,1778,4740,112,4096,592,NA,NA,25,52,NA,2122,0.212753,69,85,45,0.652174,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,22,8,7472,4132,1759,550,540,1090,22,21,21.298591,64784,23778,0.367035,2

It sounds like mainly teaching human-cadaver anatomy labs for pre-health! Plenty of jobs that are way more eco-evo adjacent have been removed.  AP) @2 we've always accepted anatomy & physiology positions like this, since a lot of animal ecophysiologists can fit the bill  3) I know people in the department, its a dumpster fire.   Those faculty were reinstated, but only because court said they must.  They had court case yesterday.  None of them are teaching or allowed on campus. They just do research or teach topics that are not accepted by conservative stances. yes, its political 100%. They were not causing trouble.  Better get used to this in republican states.

It's a bit of a culture shock, but from a career perspective, the transfer from postdoc to new faculty was made so much easier by my new collaborators, strong financial support, and no immediate teaching responsibilities. If you never imagined yourself in MS, I would still encourage you to consider it and apply!   2) By going through the position requirements, it seems that the ideal candidate should be with the backgroud of fisheries science, am I right?  My research mainly focuses on water quality management for stratified lakes and reservoirs, so should I apply for the position??? (1) Absolutely! I am not on the search committee, but my understanding is that the water quality/limnology is a major component. The position could work for anyone from an ecologist to an environmental engineer. The folks here are excited about complimentary skill sets and are extremely collaborative, finding the aquaculture angle won't be an issue. 3) Would anyone know how dangerous this location might be to someone in a same-sex relationship? 4) I live in a nearby city and have spent much of my life inn the southeastern US. I would say generally speaking college towns and any decent sized city in the south is safe and generally welcoming for anyone, including same-sex couples. My colleagues who are in same-sex relationships sometimes become uncomfortable outside of the city in more rural areas, but even then I wouldn't characterize these states as likely to be dangerous in a physical sense, but more so in terms of discriminatory laws and regulations. 5) this position is in Stoneville, not Starkville 4 again) Ah, whoops. An important clarification. I don't know anything about Stoneville, but it does appear to be more rural than Starkville. So not sure what vibes would be like there. 6) seems that less than 1000 people living in Stoneville??? If so, it is even not a village, it is a SMALL residential community。。。。。7) I did my master's with this department in Starkville and loved it. Highly recommend the department as some really great people work there. However, I also briefly worked in the Stoneville area for part of my project and would say that area is very rural Mississippi. It's in the Delta area which is about as deep south as one can get. (1 again) The location is the most challenging part so far, if you are a city person or extrovert you might go stir crazy. Stoneville itself isn't a town, most people live in the surrounding area from various degrees of big house in open country to small towns like Lake Village or Cleveland. Closest big city is Memphis about 2h away. If you get an interview, you can always assess if it's somewhere you could see yourself even for a few years as a stepping stone. 8) The delta (Ark+MS+LA) is the poorest part of the country.  IT is poorer than Appalacia.  Low educational attainment, bible belt extreme.  The worst parts of Deliverance.  Jim Henson was born there.

Your experience may be not be right on the target but may be a complementary skillset to their department needs. I would say that plant ecology/conservation could fit really nicely to the forestry definition. 3) As a forester, I would agree - especially since the current trend is towards ecological forestry (and all the production-focused folks probably go to Cal State Humbolt!). I'd apply but the cost of living scares me. 4) Can anyone confirm typical teaching load in this department? Seems like it could be be 3 courses per quarter X 3 quarters = 9 courses per year? 5) 3 classes a quarter + research is an enormous assignment wow. I know teaching profs who are 2/2/2 and no research 3) Teaching loads in forestry departments can sometimes be higher than in others - definitely worth asking about how labs are considered (I've been at universities where they don't count at all and others where they count as an entire class) 6) SC member here: teaching loads at this department are usually two to three classes a quarter, and once transition to semesters take place it will be two larger classes per semester.

The spring is similar but with an additional 3 contact hour course. Other people may teach multiple lab sections for the same course. So there is some variation, but think 9 hours per week in the fall + 12 hours per week in the spring, in front of students. We also have several online courses, and those are structured differently. 9) @ 8 so how many contact hours on average would you say that amounts to? Are there TAs or other supports for those with labs? 10) @8, I'd say 9 hours per week one semester and 12 hours per week the next semester is pretty accurate if you're teaching all in-person courses.

Seems a bit odd. Not sure if it's worth the time. 3) internal hire speculation: drink! 4) @3... normally I wouldn't speculate about such things and think people read way too much into target/internal/spousal hires but this wording is downright odd and red flag-ish 1) @4 agree - whether a spousal hire or some other specific circumstance, it seems like there is no other scenario in which you co-apply as a strategy within a 2-week application window.  5) Yes, the speculation seems warranted here. 6) From the Search Committee, we do not have internal applicants identified for these positions.  The short turnaround for applications is simply an attempt to have new faculty in place for fall 2025.  If you have questions about the positions, the department, etc. it’s best to contact the search chair, Lisa Wallace (lewallac@odu.edu). 7) Current asst prof here…I think of ODU as a hidden gem: supportive and welcoming R1; some great research in the dept; very reasonable teaching; good colleagues; nice location near the beach; and affordable cost of living. 4) could somone on the SC maybe then give some insight on the oddly specific cover letter instructions? Can we discuss hypothetical collaborations with other applicants?  I have heard great things about ODU but don't want to waste my time applying if you're looking for existing collborating pairs (8) Another Search Committee member here. We heard about the negative talk here and want to set the record straight. We are advertising two positions so wanted to impart that we want to support collaborators. Not sure what is weird about the ad. We are trying to be inclusive. We are hiring two people and want to encourage collaborators that might be worried that their research overlaps. If you don't have anyone you are collaborating with that is applying, so be it. Apply as you typically would. There is no hidden messaging in our ad. The short turnaround is simply due to administrative red tape. We wanted this ad out in August. 4) #3 again. Like I said: internal hire speculation--drink! As this thread illustrates, even seemingly savvy people who think that can distinguish between baseless and well-founded internal hire speculation can't actually do so. x2 9) Letters required in advance, or solicited later? 8) LORs solicited later; just need contact info for now 9) thanks! 10) I see the teaching load appears to be 12 credits per semester, with chances to buy-out. Can SC member speak to the teaching load, as it seems (on paper) to be pretty high for an R1? 11) Current prof here, teach load is typically 1 UG lecture/lab in 1 semester and 1 grad lecture in other semester for research active faculty 12) Note they require a copy of your graduate transcripts at application 13) between that and the shady language they must really not want folks to apply 14) I sure hope you're being sarcastic 13. 14) Thanks, SC!

Cornell is wonderfully interdisciplinary, with lots of flexibility to join other graduate fields. Grad fields host graduate programs, not departments.

The search ad seems pretty focused on water usage as a component (ecosystem services, I guess?), and I have done none of that. Would it still make sense to apply? 6) #4 again.

I will check periodically for any questions. 2) Teaching load and salary info available? 3) Current Asst. Profs are at 61K base salary for 9 months and then you can earn summer salary for teaching or through grants. The teaching load is 15 contact hours over two semesters which generally is 4 courses and one of the courses has a lab. In first couple of years we work to help minimize teaching load by sharing material and limiting too many new preps. 4) 61K seems incredibly low for a research focused institution. any plan to make that salary way more competitive? x4 5) @1 why doesn't the ad mention eco/evo if the search is really broad? x2 6) Salary is not ideal and the institution is working to make salaries more competitive, but it will take time. Cost of living in Mobile is low and the housing market is comparatively good for buyers compared to most cities. Eco/Evo not directly mentioned due to administrative process at university but we will happily consider applicants from eco/evo background that have cell/molec/computation as part of their skillset. Specifically, we need someone that can teach in the Cell Biology and/or Genetics rotation. 7) Very much appreciate the open info... but oof. Sure, it's 9 month, but 61k is literally the new NIH minimum for a postdoc...... bleak. x2 8) Not bleak at all, as context is important. Base salary, which is negotiable, is only part of determining if the position is a good fit. The healthcare package and benefits package are excellent and affordable, cost of living is low, and the Mobile area is lovely. Current Asst. Profs are all happy, start-up packages have been great, tenure expectations are clear and reasonable, the teaching load is good for our sized institution, and there are great supportive colleagues in the department and across campus. Then, the students in our department are appreciative and responsive to faculty who care about teaching and mentorship, we have had standing room only in our student org meetings, and the department and faculty are being recognized across campus for success in teaching, research, and service. Overall, the university is growing in students, programs, and resources and we have administrators that are working to make everything better. I am quite excited about the future and hope we can find a colleague who enjoys being able to conduct research in their interest area, who wants to make a positive difference for undergraduate and graduate students, and who wants to contribute to the department and university to make positive changes. 7 again) Very nice context. Thanks! x3 9) when you say can't list eco/evo for administrative reasons, can you elaborate? Is teaching evolution a concern at this university? 10) @9 no concern teaching evolution at all within the department or univeristy, we submitted an initial line request and initial job ad as more of a cellular/molecular position which was approved by the provost office, as we really need help from someone capable teaching cell biology and/or genetics.  However, research expertise in evolutionary genetics, eco-physiology, or any eco/evo, cellular/molecular combination would be strongly considered, if candidates are capable of teaching cell or genetics in addition to courses in area of expertise.","1","Match, exact","University of South Alabama","AL",102094,"Mobile","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Professional-dominant","Four-year, full-time, selective, higher transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Midsize","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,2159,1057,43,279,0,3538,50571,531,20,679,0,0,15,28,15,28,89,1247,752,1407,15,0,14397,16398,14224,12607.333333,9050,5174,7605,1182,6,257,4188,986,1550,28,593,98,NA,NA,21,51,NA,1593,0.450254,48,47,22,0.458333,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,1,0,17,7,3217,162,1469,503,480,980,20,19,19.900674,8084,5904,0.730332,2

Please state your preferred location in your application. 2) $74,000 & New York City nice try x2 @2-- satisfaction of working for small business tho 3) see the general discussion tab about Nature papers and ethics lol 4) your office would be in a high rise in downton NYC at the very tip of manhattan island. doesnt get more iconic than that! 5) based on the numer of editors at NEE and the number of papers they publish per year, it seems that they need to make at least 10k from each paper (and likely much more given the operational cost and the huge profit margin). This does not seems to be an efficient way to spend the public funding on 6) @ 5 you don't make money with that attitude. 7) My soul is worth slightly more /unless/ the benefits are poppin 8) 74K in NYc?? No wonder so many Nature articles get retracted. Also, no wonder outstanding papers are frequently rejected.  YOu gotta be pretty lousy to want to take $74K to be a fulltime editor and live downtown NYC. 9) LOL this is like 2/3 the minimum cost of living for NYC. For a company with some of the highest profit margins and a billionaire CEO. 6) @ 7, 8, 9: why are you pegging yourselves at the low end of the range? I guess 7's soul isn't actually worth more.  8) @6, well, Sr. ed starts at $94, and a living salary is nortwards of $138.  So, in what world do you negotiate a 25-30% increase in startig salary?  That is  a pipedream. 10) As a current NYC resident who makes less than $74K a year and supports two kids, the salary question is far more nuanced than this discussion is suggesting. Are you part of a one-income or a two-income family? Where do you want to live? There are neighborhoods other than those in Manhattan (downtown NYC is not a place). As highly trained professionals, we all feel our labor is valuable, and I absolutely agree that it is. But don’t scare someone away from this job just because the salary isn’t as high as you would be happy with. Many people do live in NYC on less than this salary. 8) nobody is scaring anyone away.  This publisher can afford to pay a reasonable wage or let people live elsewhere.  There is about as much reason that an editor for springer-nature journals has to be in NYC as there is to mandate purple hair.  As a former longterm editor of a society journal, its a thankless job with tons of work, yet I could do it all from my home.  Everyone SHOULD boycott corporate journals.  But we won't. 9) Unfortunately there aren't real viable alternatives. Most society journals are run by corporate publishers and the few 'independent' journals don't really have enough of a reputation to replace them. 10) This isn't even competitive compared to postdoc pay scales. 11) I spoke to someone who worked for Nature Micro at a conference not too long ago - these are starting positions. Everyone who sticks around gets promoted and a higher salary after about a year. These postions also come with lots of travel funding, enough to get to 5+ international conferences per year. 12) ok but @11 that doesn't address why this cannot be a remote position? Is glad-handing in the Manhattan office a requirement of the job? 13) @12 if they allow you to be in NJ or Philly (or China lol)then no, the Manhattan office is not required. 12) ok fair I didnt see the other office options given all the talk about NY here. Still seems silly it isn't remote? 13) Wow. Just apply if you're interested and don't if you're not. Since when was a spreadsheet the place to make social change? x9 14) also let's keep it manageable for the APs and kind in general. This is an exceptional job finding resource, and the majority of readers are fellow job-seeking desperados who don't want to fight over crumbs (15) Does anyone see the place to upload the cover letter and 500-word sci discussion requested? Only see a spot for the CV. No word from email helpdesk (16) I think you can drag multiple files into the same place you upload the cv. (15) THANKS @#16. If we both get offers let's rent that trash can in 'downtown NYC' together (16) @#15 haha! Good luck with your application :) I actually picked Shanghai as even $40-50k would be a pretty good salary there. (17) Hopefully, like the journal itself, they reject us quickly. Hopefully, unlike the journal itself, they give us some feedback on why. (18) I received a rejection letter saying ""we are proceeding with a candidate whose background more closely aligns to the needs of the position."" If this candidate is reading this, may I ask what backgrounds you have? Do you work on global change ecology or microbial ecology? Do you have editorial experiences?

"" 4) SC can you speak to the longevity of the position if it is not tenure stream? 5) (SC) -permanent position, the track (General Faculty) has promotion at 5 yrs and regular review with ""expectation of continued employment"", last person was in the position 29 years; residence - current expectation is to be based in C'ville during the academic year, Station at other times.  6) Salary? 7) ~$85k based on salary data? has to be 12 month if residence required.  8) in otherwords, its not permanent, its at will.  9) Questions for SC chair: Does the position include startup funds for research or is the candidate more expected to facilitate the research of UVA faculty/collaborators? I'm unsure from the description of the research mentoring statement if I'm supposed to propose my own undergrad research program or talk about how I would mentor for the existing projects at MLBS. Also, is housing at MLBS provided to the candidate or would they need to find their own each summer? If housing is provided, does it accomodate others (i.e. if the candidate has a family)? What are the primary duties during the academic year, teaching? grant writing? manuscirpt preparation? or is there enough going on at MLBS that it requires year-round coordination/logistic work in order to have a productive summer season? (10) (SC) Onsite housing would be provided, families included; Duties outside of high season are chiefly administrative, including securing funding for REU program and other station programs and activities, some effort to the individuals independent research is expected; MLBS does not have ""proprietary"" research - the position supports others and develops their own independent research involving students 11) im absolutely intrigued by this job but I just cant figure out what they want in an application. I feel qualified but are there expectations for major research grants (in addition to infrastructure grants as described in ad)? can this position have graduate students or only undergrads? what is the teaching load during the academic year? 12) I'm curious about the search timeline, apps are due Nov 15, but start date is January 2025, so are they doing interviews? campus visits? It seems likely the chosen candidate would receive an offer in December, but how are they going to get out of a lease (or sell a house) that quickly to relocate? 13) (SC) The position will not be able to advise graduate students directly, but can serve on graduate committees. There is NO formal course teaching associated with the position. Grant expectations are to secure funding that supports station activities. Personal research grants would be encouraged, supported, but not expected.

SEAS is a fantastic place to work.  Happy to try to answer questions here - will do my best to check in periodically. 1) Could SC comment on the teaching load? Gievn that SEAS has a model whereinn there are a lot of coursework-based Masters students (as opposed to theses-based Masters), does that translate to higher teaching load for faculty? 2) the ad mentions ""a list of three names"" but interfolio wants three documents (not names), and these are a requirement for submission on this platform. Should we just duplicate a pdf 3 times?  SC: @1 in SEAS we teach 2.5 classes/year - the MS students either do a Master's Project (a group of students working together) or a traditional Master's thesis.  You can advise the projects to take care of some of your teaching load, but you don't have to.  You can advise theses if you'd like but aren't required to - advising theses does not count toward your teaching, as it's viewed as furthering your research agenda.  Overall, it's very flexible and I'd say the Master's Project advising can reduce your course load but doesn't have to. In discussions with the EEB faculty here, the SEAS teaching load seems very similar to the EEB load.  @2 yes, please do that and sorry about that!

' 1) By AI do you just mean machine learning? Or the likes of ChatGPT? Are you searching for a computer scientist/bioinformatician or an ecologist who can program? 2) I am not going to blame this SC specifically but I wish so many people overall didn't conflate traditional ML and LLMs or similar. 3) Not surprising - its the newest fad that acedemia is trying to cash in on, but, jobs are jobs I guess! 4) honestly insane to see an eco-evo ad for a TT position that must integrate AI in their program. Is this just using machine learnin?? 5) SC member here: there will likely be multiple hires from this listing, and there is interest in the use of AI (as very broadly defined) and expertise spanning data scientists and ecologists who can program. 6) It’s 100% traditional ML/LLMs/insert-your-favorite-combination-of-logistic/linear-regressions-with-some-activation-functions-and-transformers-in-between but use the word “AI”. If you’re pioneering something that’s going to replace that (when OpenAI has presently raked in over $10B using that style of “AI”), then you might want to try for a compsci department (or just make your billions in startup funding…). 7) While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are a prominent branch of AI, they represent just one approach to artificial intelligence. AI is probably just a marketing term rather than an accurate terminology but generally when people talk about AI its likely sought after deep learning, or deep neural networks. Machine learning is similar to Deep Learning but significant difference is that the data that you feed to ML models need to be tabular. In contrast, Deep Learning can learn from any given data automatically. It could be any from of unstructured data, although encoding methods do seem to matter. 8) Looks like review date is Nov 10, not Nov 1.

Lots of faculty leaving and both searches they had last year failed. I have friends that went through 3 or 4 labs because their advisors kept leaving. The university is broke and Carbondale doesn't have much to offer. 3) Is that why the faculty page for biology is the director and an admin specialist and no one else? 4) @2 is unfair in their assessment. Most faculty recently leaving were retirements. Financial situation has been improving with positive trend in enrollment over the last 3 years. SIU's financial situation isn't any worse than most similar-sized school in the state/midwest @3 The School of Biological Sciences is three programs, faculty are listed under the zoology, plant biology, and microbiology pages, I know it's confusing. 6) Graduated from this department and I absolutely cannot recommend working here. Lots of toxic dynamics among faculty and especially between facutly and student relationships. Carbondale and the surrounding area are great if you are into the outdoors and enjoy smaller towns. The department and lack of support from university administration is not worth it however. 7) are a bunch of unhappy grads from SIU lurking or was that just the same guy twice? 3) Either is possible; SIU was BIG news ~8-10 years ago for being in bad shape. They advertised looking for alumni to come back to adjunct for free. 8) Current BioSci faculty here. Certainly SIUC has its issues, but some of the stuff I'm reading here is pretty misleading (one of those searches never launched, another 'failed' because offers were leveraged and we came up short). Lots of our labs have very content grads and are fully funded. Previous to this position I was at another institution and this job has been a huge improvement in almost every way. Most of us want to see whoever comes here to do so with a full appreciation of what we have to offer, we in no way plan to oversell our institution or these positions. Genuinely, we are looking to build our program with great faculty colleagues. 9) The rest of you can just not apply, make it more likely I'll get hired.  I would absolutely die to work at SIUC. NO LIE! 10) As @8 says, there is a lot to like about the deparment and Carbondale would be a good place to raise a family. While some of the details may be questionable, the overall spirit of comments from @2 and @6 are valid too (I wasn't there when those searches happened, so I can't comment). It's undeniable that quite a few faculty did leave and there is a lot of toxicity, especially from full professors in zoology and plant biology. I wouldn't tell you not to apply, but ask a lot of questions and make sure the positives outweigh the negatives given your personal situation. 7) what does ""talent pool search"" mean? 10) talent pool search is odd. Judging from the comments above, it sounds like they are looking for anyone to fill one of many needs they have. 11) This is a cluster hire, we are hoping to fill four positions with this search. 12) Another current faculty. I absolutely love it here, I can drop two children in two different schools and make it here by 8 sharp, it is a vibrant community with a lot of interesting intellectuals -even at PKs- and the unmatched natural beauty of the Shawnee.  Departures always invite for introspection and the introspection resulting from these departures brings changes; I am sad seeing colleagues retiring or leaving for other opportunities, yet that turn over had engaged us in conversations about our identity, our interactions and our goals as the School of Biological Sciences. Also, let me tell you that I identify myself as a member of an underrepresented group in the sciences and yes, money and facilities are areas that need improvement.  HOWEVER I have always received the support of my colleagues. We are seeking for colleagues who are willing and able to make a change. Come work with us if you have the drive to be part of a positive change. 13) @11 do you mean four positions all in the subject area (global change, human-modified environments, and/or sustainability)? 11) Global change/human-modified/sustainability is the broad theme, we are looking for a range of expertise/discipline (eg ecology, evolutionary biology, physiology, zoonotic diseases) as well ability to teach different subject areas.","2","Match, by alias","Southern Illinois University-Carbondale","IL",149222,"Carbondale","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Professions plus arts & sciences, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, inclusive, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Classified","Great Lakes IL IN MI OH WI","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Small","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",93,2635,770,135,170,0,3803,41617,0,10,846,38,18,46,33,102,33,243,697,736,1899,93,0,11695,13129,11366,9572,8299,3067,6791,1324,5,179,1879,1188,1322,39,908,227,NA,NA,31,51,NA,558,0.146726,76,92,45,0.592105,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,25,15,4492,781,435,470,460,930,20,17,18.073191,6165,5658,0.917762,1

People say it is ""better"" but it is still a toxic work environment. Seem to handle obvious or blant sexual assault rapidly (from what I have seen) but other toxic power dyanmics continue to exist. Reporting system seems extremely ineffective and there is still a lot of unchecked behavior and this not just from folks who have been there awhile. Can't speak to what it was like there before these articles came out but there is a still a lot of work to be done. 4) Was a fellow at STRI during the years covered in the above article. I will just echo the comments of others that while there are serious efforts being made to improve things, there are still entrenched power dynamics that are problematic.  And yes, I never felt safe working or traveling alone as a woman in many parts of Panama, so that's an important factor to consider in terms of whether you would want to live there long-term. 5) I was a fellow when all the news became public. Agree on everything that was already said about STRI itself, but not completely about Panama. There are issues like any big city. I wasn't alone but I did travel a lot and had a great experience everywhere I went, really enjoyed getting to know Panama and its people, cultures etc. I personally would not go back to STRI, but not because of the country.","","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It looks more like a historical affiliation, but insights into that would be helpful. And how much opportunity is there for research with students realistically, its listed in the ad, but are there resources for research? 4) No effect of religious affilitation - purely historical. Excellent support for student research - More or less guaranteed funding for students to live on campus and conduct research over the summers. Students conduct research for course credit over the semesters. Happy to answer any other questions. 5) Heads up: seems like this one sends auto-requests for letters when you submit! (this was not clear to me from the listing...) 6) the listing says it only needs names of references. This is not good to have it automatically ask. 7) SC can you elaborate on whether letters are expected up front or if you only need names of references upon submission? Also when letters are due by once requests are sent out? 6) Man people are getting in a twist about letters up front. It is not uncommon (heck very recently it was the norm), but also it never matters. If you're worried about it, send your letter writers a note that there's no rush. I often tell writers not to bother until I got a phone interview, at which point the institution will prompt you - a late letter has never stopped me getting an interview. 8) letters up front are annoying and waste time, but in this case the issue is that the application only asked for names, indicating letters would be requested later and then automatically sent requests. Applicants like to be able to give their writers a heads up on timelines and when this switch happens, we look like we snuck in an extra letter and its annoying, especially when we don't know what timeline is going to show up.

I enjoyed doing my PhD there and new faculty seemed to fit into the community quickly. 4) Queer person who did my PhD there - it is very small and isolated, ~1.5 hours from Spokane which is the nearest large airport, shopping location, etc. It has gotten better in Pullman since I left (i.e. they opened a target so now you can shop there instead of having to drive to spokane for such a luxury), but it is still a small community if you have any sort of historically-excluded identity. The health care can also be very difficult given how rural it is, a lot of my queer friends had to drive the 6+ hours for gender affirming surgeries in Seattle so if you need any sort of 'specialty care' beware. You can definitely find community there, but it takes some effort. The Moscow Coop, the Moscow Farmer's Market and the roller derby teams were all highlights of the area along with the aforementioned outdoor activities 5) I am a junior PI in this dept and want to share that I have been amazed at how supportive the community in this department is; it is incredibly collegial and everyone has been very friendly and helpful. Setting up a lab is dang hard and everyone I work with, from faculty to staff to the college admin, has wanted to help me succeed. Pullman/Moscow is a pretty cool college town with a surprisingly great food scene and easy access to stunning outdoor recreation. I worked with a number of people who had lived in this area before moving here and almost all of them wanted to move back. My students have had great experiences with the student health center for their day to day care, though (like many places!) you need to travel for the really big stuff. 4) Left this region recently and agree with the comments above - but to add in one huge stressor: it was incredibly hard to find daycare for my child. We were on waitlists at every single (credible) daycare in the Moscow/Pullman region for months and I was still left without daycare for about 6 months after we moved (about 1 year total on the waitlists). My partner and I just had to figure things out on our own and it was incredibly stressful. This region is one of the most liberal parts of Idaho, but also one of the more conservative areas of WA. 5) Childcare is a huge issue in this area, we were on a waiting list for 1.5 years and ultimately left without ever securing a spot, it was as #4 says a HUGE source of stress. We made it work but only barely. 6) I did my PhD at WSU, and I found the healthcare pretty abysmal. The student healthcare center is pretty good for run-of-the-mill issues (very easy to use, etc.), but I don't think this is a good place for anyone with complex medical issues or rare conditions. I also am surprised anyone would say the food is good there. I had a couple places I liked, but I had to think really hard to remember them. All in all, I did like living in Pullman by the end. It's a very unique landscape. That said, I also had a really hard time adjusting to the isolation when I arrived, and sunset is like...350 PM around the solstice. This is not a good place for people who are prone to SAD. In my observation, Pullman is wonderful for some people, bad for others. I personally could not move there at this point in my life because the medical system is not adequate for my needs. 7) Any updates? 8) haven't heard anything 11/1 X2 9) Zoom interview request (11/1)","9","Match, exact","Washington State University","WA",236939,"Pullman","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Professions plus arts & sciences, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Town Distant","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","Yes",0,6058,937,356,284,0,7635,294831,40370,193,838,43,17,204,92,264,92,590,631,2238,3820,0,0,31607,35394,31159,27703.666667,25470,5689,22253,2831,62,324,3661,2028,4040,151,2094,421,NA,NA,28,52,NA,1413,0.185069,78,112,44,0.564103,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,24,18,7923,3484,954,510,510,1020,20,20,20,21198,16947,0.799462,2

""we are especially interested in candidates with a focus on plant and/or fungal biology"" - but remember, they are or have already shut down their herbarium...Someone from Duke here: The herbarium has not yet been shut down, and is probably going to be relocated to UNC which is only a 30min drive away 2) Thanks, that is good news regardless 3) Does that mean that at least one hire will be plant/fungal, or that the preference is for all three to be in that area? 4) Again, ""especially"". I still have no idea if it would be a waste of time for me to apply.  5) Sounds like a waste of time to apply if they're relocating the herbarium 6) Duke's program for plant science kinda deserves to this if they are moving that Herbarium. Not saying that is the department's fault but man f*** the admin. As a plant person there is no way I will apply here. If a Duke person is reading this you are welcome to pass that to your superiors. 7) Agree that the herbarium thing sucks, but what I want to know is whether it's worth applying to this position as a non plant, non fungus person? 8) @ ""Someone from Duke"": Sure, it may be relocated close by (btw, since it would no longer be the Duke Herbarium, ""shut down"" isn't inaccurate), but the issue is what it says about the support for plant/fungal organismal biology to be expected from department and university leadership. I was here and would strongly urge folks who care about non-model organisms to avoid this department. 8) @7 This is a department that has been wiling to waste a lot of people's time in past searches with criteria NOT in the job ad, so proceed at your own risk. For what it's worth, I don't believe the ""especially plant/fungal biology"" and think it is just a bone thrown to faculty in those areas after last year's ""any area of biology"" search ended up with a near-total animal focus. 9) Were any hires made from that search last year? x2 10) Yes, multiple hires were made. 11) I’m curious whether marine ecologists, with broad contributions to ecology, would still be considered for this Department, or if they might be seen as a better fit for the Duke Marine Lab and therefore less likely to be selected. Any thoughts? x2   12) I feel like some of these posts are trying to sow sour grapes before they apply, instead of after rejections get emailed out. x2 6) meh, I 100% will simply not be applying as someone who works on plants. Thats not a facade or trying to sow sourness or whatever. There is a UNC plant bio job posted now...gonna spend my efforts there. 13) Can anyone speak to the departmental culture? 6) don't know the department but I know one of their newest hires and they are a great colleague. x2 14) @13 I'm a new hire in the dept and have been happy with dept culture. It's awesome to have come in with a cohort, and my hope is that this plant/fungal-focused cohort will also feel supported. 15) Former Duke person here--no direct skin in the game about the herbarium but knowledge about how it went down. The public relations efforts by the pro-herbarium side are shockingly unfair. It made zero financial sense whatsoever to keep the herbarium. Other departments declined to take over funding it because the fiscal reality was so obvious. The biology department at Duke is amazing. Culture is unlike anywhere else I've seen. Graduate students are happy and respected and administrative support for all kinds of logistics is top notch. Duke is a dream job and I'll be envious of whoever gets these positions  14) on a different note, what do they want in the ""References"" section?  Just contact info for each reference? It looks like it was set up incorrectly b/c we cannot request letters and it just wants 3 pdfs??  15) Just contact info for each references at this stage 16) @15 Was very amused reading your comment when a chunk of the most recent program review was about how unhappy and disrespected the grad students felt. Culture there is, indeed, unlike anywhere else I've seen. May also be worth noting that Duke apparently has an explicit policy against TT partner hires (https://partnerhirescorecard.org/ranking?Partner-friendly%20status=Doesn%E2%80%99t+create+faculty+positions). 17) i'm faculty at duke and have been through the process for multiple spousal hires, it is no different than most places i've seen. spouse isn't guaranteed TT job, but if there is a strong CV and dept fit then there is usually some extra money from the dean to incentivize an extra hire. we've had multiple examples through my time here 18) so is the deadline for this actually 11/15? if I submit past 10/15 does that hurt my chances? 19) Review for first round of applicants starts 10/15, then it's rolling until 11/15 20) still wondering about an answer to #18. (21) Anyone hear anything? (22) no and I wouldn't expect anything for several weeks.... 40 people on this board applied, which translates to like 300 apps recieved.

Teach four undergraduate courses per year (quarter system). 2) This is a teaching position with potential security of employment. Shouldn't really be listed as 'tenure stream'. 3) what is ""tenure stream"" if not potential employment security? 4) Former UC faculty here. We have this discussion on the board every year. UC lecturer or professor of teaching positions with security of emplyoment are tenure. From the UC academic manual (https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-285.pdf): ""All appointments and promotions to the ranks of Associate Professor of Teaching and Professor of Teaching shall continue until terminated by resignation, retirement, or dismissal. An appointment with security of employment shall not be terminated except for good cause after the opportunity for a hearing before the properly constituted advisory committee of the Academic Senate, in accordance with Regents’ Bylaw 40 and Senate Bylaws 336 or 337."" 5) Why does this teaching position require a Statement of Research? Also, any insights into whether there are specific courses they are looking to fill? The ad is very broad...1) As 4 mentioned, this ia a debate every year. But since the ad literally says tenure track, I posted as such. I debated if I should put the rank as Asst Prof of Teaching though. I'm curious if PoTs are able to do research with undergrads (ad mentioned mentoring). 6) @5 one of my good friends is a PoP at Davis (different dept), his research is focused on pedagogy, Teaching-as-Research types of investigations. 1) I looked up the current PoT's in EVE and their research is also pedagogical.  7) Search commitee chair here, rank is correct for assistant professor of teaching; this position is eligible for the equivalent of tenure for ladder rank faculty; expectation is to have scholarly activities around teaching and pedagogy, which can include pedagogical research, discipline-based education, or assessment research among other areas and activities.  Some PoTs at UCD also have disciplinary research as part of their programs, but expectation is to have components of pedagogical and educational research.  8) Thanks for the clarification, SC! Just to confirm then the statement of research should be on pedagogical research? 9) May be worth changing the subject area section to reflect this. x2 10) Yes, your research statement should make clear how you will engage in furthering the science of science teaching, pedagogy, assessment, etc. 1) @10 I don't know if is possible for the committee to edit the job ad, but it might be worth adding that info to the research statement description. Rereading the ad, I can see where it asks for these skills, but it definitely isn't clear that this is what the research statement should focus on. x2 12) I applied and at first it made it seem like letter requests would only happen when the candidate makes it past screening but when filling it out it made you send letter requests on the spot - kind of odd. I guess in rereading the details they are saying they will only contaact the referees if you are the #1 choice but I guess letters are up front? either way I wish the ad had been more clear about it.

It has gone up in the past 5 years or so, but it is still slightly lower than the national average. Also, they overstated the cost of family homes.

I wouldn't say it's clear. 6) @3 Heard they were also looking for a plant-focus, is that true? 7) @3 incorrect, the original round interviewed were all postdocs. @4 students and postdocs in the department who I have spoken with, do not find it toxic. @5 it is for assistant, compare it to the other open position (Animal Comp Phys & Biomechanics) where it says ""tenure track or tenured"". @6 no taxonomic focus, the original round interviewed none worked on plants. 8) Why does everyone always assume that ivy's are toxic? Is this some sort of a jealousy thing? 9) OEB did have an earned reputation for toxicity...20 years ago. The hires since have made good strides in collegiality. Perhaps, though, people are reading into discussions of the university as a whole... 10) Eh, some of those new hires are definitely upholding old traditions. It's a mixed bag, as with most places. 11) @10 on what basis are you making these allegations?  12) I interviewed there, the chalk talk was rough, some professors were intentionally repeating the same intense question with comments such as ""At Harvard we do XYZ"", that tension has not happened in other Ivy leagues, I think that culture is not necessary for excellence. My host was nice though. 13) Interesting @12. I'm current pd in OEB, and have not experienced that specific thing here. Absolutely have at 2 other interviews (not ivies but very wealthy highly ranked places, 1 in Europe). In both cases it was old white men though. 14) For all candidates out there, don't get your hopes very high with this particular position as they are opening it as a Tenure Track mainly to recruit a specific professor from Princeton University. Therefore, if you want to have a chance, also try applying to the other OEB positions listed above. 15) Can anyone comment on the Nature/Science pub expectations here? I've seen from other Ivy that they only consider CVs with such pubs, but I know many places are trying to change that culture... 16) Current postdoc in OEB. Multiple of the interviewed candidates last year had no CNS, although I think most or maybe all had something like PNAS or Nature comms. 17) @15 it is completely untrue that Ivys or other similarly prestigious places require you to have CNS (or K99 or whatever ""requirements"" people make up) to be hired. 18) To get tenure at Harvard you have to be quantifiably at the top of your [sub]field. While there's no strict requirements to get hired, you have to prove that you are on track to be ""the best"" at what you do. I don't see how that's possible without flashy highly cited pubs. 17) @18 sure, and that's kind of the case at any top school, but we're talking about getting hired, not getting tenure. CNS is neither necessary nor is it sufficient to get you a job.18) @17 you might want to re-read my comment, buddy 19) More helpful (from a purely empirical standpoint) is if you've held a Harvard junior fellowship or at least have studied at another Ivy. 20) Worht looking at what % of TT hires actually get tenure there... 21) yea the comment about CNS for getting hired vs tenure is relevant but like...do you really want to barely manage to get the job there only to find that you are expected to massively overperform for the next 5 years or you lose tenure? getting tenure in this department is no walk in the park. 22) If you have questions about the postion you should reach out directly to the committee chair instead of relying on hearsay; the dept has an extremely high success rate for tenure based on looking at their website. 23) @14 Is the search really directed towards a specific professor? Is it even worth applying then? x4 24) Given the lack of details in the ad - how long is the text you're writing for each of the statements (research, service, teaching)?

(2) It's not clear which documents are required, also unofficial UG and grad transcripts required? 3) does anyone know much about the dept culture and teaching load? 4) search committee member here. Sorry, the UG transcripts are required because of HR, I know it's weird. The things the search committee is requesting are cover letter, CV, three reference letters, and 2-page research and teaching statements that incorporate contributions to DEI. If there's anything else on the platform that is required is stuff HR added. The teaching load is often 1-2. One of those classes if often a ""biggish class"" (anywhere from 30 to 100 students), one class that relates to the expertise of the faculty (in this case something on evolution), and a third class which is usually a 1 credit seminar. The department is diverse in terms of topics and expertise, there's an imbalance in terms of ranks, so there's a lot of full proffesors and very few jr faculty but there's upcoming hires in the next few years to balance things out. In terms of collaborations, it really depends on what you work with, there's a bunch of animal people in the department so this hire should have plenty of people to collaborate with. Faculty are nice and colleagial with your usual 1-2 exceptions who we all hope they will retire soon.    5) do insects count as animals or is this a vertebrate biology position? 6) Any animal is welcomed not only vertebrates. 7) SC member here - our new HR platform is .... not great. It automatically requests transcripts from *all* applicants. Transcripts are not a required document and you do not have to upload those (they should show up as an ""optional"" document on the application platform); the committee will not be considering transcripts during application review. Also note that the closing date for applications is 10/25/24 and letters will be requested after the search closes. Yes, this is another annoying feature of our HR platform that we are trying our best to work around. There may be some incorrect deadlines floating around - the actual deadline is that one on the university site, which is 10/25/24 for applicants and 11/1/24 for letters.

They encourage applying to this job and others. This is a broad search. @3, it looks like it's a field in the interfolio application. Maybe better for a SC member to clarify. 7) Sounds very much like a diversity hire 8) @7 lol what? Your bias is showing 9) For the folks that applied- what's up with the description of area of focus? 10) @9 it isn't much: ""Please share some key ords to describe the areas of focus for your research so we can match your application with the most qualified reader."" (11) The BSD searches at UChicago are mandated to hire people from minority backgrounds, and if you are not such a person I would not apply. 12) UofC faculty member here: @11 this is absolutely false---you can read about the desired profile in the ad; @4: letters will be requested for shortlisted applicants; @3, the goal is to hire multiple people. 13) @12 thanks for the info! can you elaborate what ""description of areas of focus"" entails? 12 again) @3, 9, @13: as @10 said, the website will request some keywords to route your application to the most appropriate readers---you do not need another statement or anything elaborate. 14) is there any information on process and time line here? 15) UChicago FM: The first round of applications will be reviewed in the coming week or two, and another round at the end of the month. Departments that recieve a fair number of applications will conduct long list zoom interviews, and then proceed with a on-campus interview for the short list. 16) Ok, thanks for the update! x5 17) updates? 18) no news as of 10/16 x5 19) The FM said they still have another round of reviews at the end of the month 20) Reference letters requested 10/24 X22 21) Do you know if this is from a short list, or all applicants? 22) Above the SC member said shortlisted applicants will get letter requests, but seems like a lot of us are getting that request. Must be a pretty long shortlist! 23) Just received an email stating ""We are beginning to review applications, and to prepare for the next round we are reaching out to applicants to collect contact information for your references."" on Oct 25th (could be a timezone difference). x4  23) Some schools keep a long list of half to one third, weeding out the section that are just inviable.  I appreciate that approach as a happy medium on letters upfront.  From the numbers it sounds like Chicago is in that realm. 24) ""the section that are just inviable""... oof, brutal!  23 again) Inviable often means off topic from what the committee targets. Didn't mean to imply inviable for any other job.  At one school they only looked at apps with plants, even though the job ad was general.   There may be other apps with no pubs or no postdoc that get filtered out, but none of those should be surprising. 20) Since this is a very broad search across all sectors of the BSD with multiple hires anticipated, I'm thinking that each sector might have its own ""short list"" depending on the candidates that applied within each specialty -- so maybe when you put multiple short lists together, you end up with a lot of folks moving to the next stage across the whole search, but for each sector, there might truly only be a few candidates they're considering. 25) will there be a second round of reviews? Wondering it there is still time to apply given that they are already requesting references 26) @25, SC member said above (15) that there was a review end of October. They'd have to chime in again to give us more details. 26) Anyones letter writers get a request yet? 27) My letter writters have not gotten a request yet. x4 28) My requests came in last night x3 29) my writers have not received one, wonder if its dept. by dept., or if this is their way of short listing x3 30) Don't get discouraged, this seems very dept by dept to me. FYI, my writers were contacted and I would be in ecology and evolution. x7 31) Just emailed the contact person and got an automatic reply stating:  ""Know that recommendation letter requests are being sent individually to all applicants, please be patient in awaiting their receipt. This process is not automatic, emails are not sent in response to completion of the reference contact form. Emails are sent after contact information is copied into the applicant’s profile on the interfolio where emails may be sent to references individually.

This trend will continue to proliferate and because of this it will require more PHD faculty. bottom line, your teaching load is about what you see at most liberal arts colleges (15 hrs), not the super SLACs, the normal ones. However, most community colleges have way more teaching support.  There are usually lab managers who prep all your labs for example. So, teaching load is higher, but its actually less work than most 12 hr load liberal arts and regioinal state universities.  Further, few community colleges care if you do research.

We are in small town midwest, but with 3 institutions of higher learning there are many queer+ friendly spaces. I felt much less welcome living in large ""blue"" cities in the southern US.

It's also asking for letters up front. 4) International person was soft offered it last time, said they would take it if hard offered, but then declined and due to Canadian requirements to hire Canadian if possible, had to write a compelling reason as to why they were hiring outside of Canada and then were unable to offer it to their second choice. 5) So 1 and 2 were non-Canadian. Were there no qualified Canadians who applied? It's weird how often that happens at UBC. 6) 2 was Canadian, but couldn't offer them the position after 1 declined.  7) Somehow I doubt this time will be the charm. 8) @7 can you elaborate? I just assume they will receive a reasonable number of qualified Canadian applicants as people want to live in Vancouver. 9) I assume they mean if they choose a foreign national again then the number Canadians applying is a moot point as they aren't allowed to go down the list, which caused the problem to begin with 10) what @9 said is accurate x2. (11) UBC offers jobs to non-Canadians primarily, and they don't want to live in Vancouver for more than a few years, and often take USA-based jobs. Good luck. (12) Check cost of living in Vancouver as well. It has skyrocketed over the past few years. Pay has not gone up commensurate with that. (13) I lived there for 6 years and I absolutely loved it, and on a grad student budget. It is hard with the cost of living, for sure, depending on what you prioritize. In some ways, the location cannot be beat. The access to nature and the variety of it is unmatched. I swam in the ocean 3x/week at the same time as friends were skiing or rockclimbing, hiking, cycling, paddleboarding etc. I truly believe I will never live anywhere as beautiful as Vancouver again. Which is fine, because I am not as outdoorsy as others. 12) can confirm that #2 didn't get the offer bc Canadian and they had already made offer to non-Canadian candidate so this is why the search failed. Again. Also UBC doesn't know what they actually want out of this position and offered it to someone with fancy named school rather than someone who was actually willing to take the job. 13) Can confirm that @12 is not correct. 14) About what, @13? Search failed twice already. Fool me twice, etc. Other non-UBC departments are able to fill such positions, frequently with qualified Canadians. What are we missing @13 There was no second choice candidate, and this had nothing to do with nationality. Also, the search committee has a clear idea of what they want. 15) just an FYI for anyone interested in this role, UBC teaching faculty are only supported to do pedagogical research not primary research in your area/background of expertise (natural sciences Eco/Evo). This was a surprise to me as research faculty also teach courses and teaching faculty are required to have expertise in their subject areas. 16) even more surprising is they recently hired a research faculty who supposedly had expertise in data science and yet apparently cannot teach it; 17) @16 what is the point in making that kind of comment about another researcher? It's a waste of time reading comments like that for applicants (doesn't actually provide any useful info) and it's a waste for the OP who have to manage these threads.","1","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

No idea what's going on. 6) again: there seems to be something wrong with Workday. I also can't access other job ad pages that use this system. 7) Former member of this department, answering the questions: @1 quite far, academics are a high paying profession in Aus, average general salary in Sydney last time I checked was around 82k. Also, on top of salary employer annually pays retirement savings (superannuation) of 17% i.e. at least $20,881. @2 under Aus system we typically have no statements and include all material in the cover letter under each of the job criteria (similar to UK applications). @6 just tried application portal and seems to be working for me. Wanted to make a general comment that these types of positions are 'permanent' as there is no tenure-track in Aus, but startup is almost non-existent. 8) Current Australian academic and wanted to add to @7. The positions are 'permanent' but there is commonly a 1-4 year (varies wildly accross universities) probation period where you will need to meet certain performance benchmarks. These are fairly reasonable, however, and is nowhere near as tough as applying for tenure 9) Guess I learned my lesson that this was 9/8/2024 local time... 10) Found the application very confusing. Wrote a specific cover letter, teaching and research statement tailored to the dept and ecology research in Australia. Suddenly my application was submitted with no clear place to have uploaded a cover letter or supporting documents, just two tiny text boxes with vague instructions. Not crossing my fingers😂 11) adding to others here with Aus experience. You do not need to submit additional materials required for jobs in other countries. The ""cover letter"" is not just a cover letter - you specifically need to address all the selection criteria and all unis have guidelines on how to do this. So the cover letter ends up being like 4-5 pages often. 12) @11, thanks for that. Woops... guess this one was a practice run. 11) @12 didn't mean to be negative, was just trying to stop anyone doing any extra unneeded work, you never know! Fingers crossed for you. If you submitted extra materials I am sure that's fine too, like I said just trying to avoid people needlessly doing extra. 12) Anyone heard anything? 13) Not yet 10/09/2024 x3 14) still no news as of 10/16 x3 15) Received an 'application declined' email on 10/28 x7","14","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In both places, it would be tough to support a family of 4 on a single salary, unless you were in the cheaper areas of the US or the UK. 6) Just an FYI: For a different post in this same department, long-listing was finished after 3 weeks.","6","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Of course it would be the one that seems pointless to even try for. 6) Strong internal candidate does not mean they'll get it! I lost out on a job I was basically a nepo hire for so some departments have integrity! 7) Sure, but strong internal hire stated in the job + zero time for applicants to apply seems pretty definitive.  8) I think everyone should send an email to the department chair thanking the department for the transparency.

Happy to answer any questions. 1) Would a hire at Associate level would be considered? SCM: @1 In this case probably not, but there is a lot of flexibilty on when to go up for tenure, so a shorter time at Assistant for an experienced person would likely be possible/negotiable. 2) ad states teaching load is 6-8 contact hours/semester- how does that typically pan out with number of lectures and labs? SCM: @2 Typically that means two lectures and an associated lab for one of the lectures, or two lectures and a graduate seminar. 3) What does a 5 year funding plan look like? Something simple like ""I will apply for these grants in these years"" or more rigorous and budgeted like ""I will fund my research on start-up for these years, assume that I get X grants to fund Y research in years Z, etc."" SCM: @3 It's meant to be a bit open ended so that you can tailor it to your planned research program, but we want to see that applicants have put some thought into where from/when during career/how much/etc. to make a sustainable research program at NMT. Of course the best laid plans oft go astray, but having a good plan here will help with your interview and with the first few years at Tech. 4) anyone heard anything about zoom interviews? 5) I haven't heard anything (10/14).

I'd say that the department in general (and E&E folks specifically) are quite close-knit and supportive. The department brings together E&E with folks in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology (who historically were in a separate department with minor differences in culture). The relationships between the E&E and MCDB people are postivive, with several labs that span the two groups. In general, I'd advise against interpreting silence. People are just busy and don't check here often. Good luck out there everyone! 8) fwiw I'm a postdoc here and I like it!

What is the salary? The comment above suggests part time or full time are possible, but the add lists this as a 0.15 FTE position. 2) Poster and member of search committee here. The ad is written with a part-time appointment in mind, but full time is also a possibility. Assuming part time, we are somewhat flexible on how and when the course meets. For a part-time appointment (just the two weeks in summer and the one course), salary can be expected to be in the range of $15,000 to $18,000 or so. 3) Just to be clear, is this Hotchkiss the high school? 4) Yes, this is an elite private high school, not a college or university. 5) FYI we have extended the deadline for this position to 9/15! 6) campus visit invite x1","2","Unmatched",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Chair the EcoMap program; 1) is this a joke?? ""Highly accomplished scientific researcher"".. 5 years experience leading a lab… salary? Barely over 100K… in Boston…yikes 2) Was a postdoc at BU making 55k... they upped minimum postdoc pay to 65k while I was there, but still not great 1 again) year it's a big step up from postdoc salary, but from the description the position is close to equivalent with a tenured faculty position/assoc prof, but paying maybe starting TT salary for the area? and low starting salary for a TT position in Boston at that. 3) They note that this is a 9-month position with expectations that part of the role would include fundraising for the remaining months. Any chance they’re listing the 9-month commitment? If so, the annual total would be closer to $150K which is looking more reasonable. 4) Maybe so, but you're unlikely to have the additional 3 mo of full time support in every year, so don't go into this (or any 9 mo academic position) expecting that you'll regularly be making the 12 month equivalent. 5) If I'm reading it right, it does look like this position is hybrid and primarily remote and you can live in MA, NY, RI, VT, NH, or ME. 6) still not competitive in that area if it's equivalent to associate level as it reads, even at nine months. 7) I was offered this position last cycle and came very close to taking it. It's a very cool opportunity, but I definitely think the fit needs to be right. I can't comment on the updated search, but last cycle the salary was for the full 12 mo (the 3 mo fundraising is an expectation - does not raise your salary). It is also completely remote, which could be a great perk, but also a challenge. The NE Aquarium will pay for travel to Boston over a certain radius. I will try to check back if there are more questions. I wish this position had worked out for me as the people were genuinely great - just wouldn't have worked for my family at the moment. Good luck! 8) Salary is not a joke...also it's a 12 month position but because there is service you are soft money for 9 months and on the institution's dime for the other 3.","","Unmatched",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I saw the discussion about Logan, UT, below, but curious if folks have perspectives to share here. 2) Orem/Provo is the heart of Mormonism, moreso than any other place in Utah. If you're not of the faith, you will definitely stand out. That said, you're pretty close to Salt Lake City, which is a great, liberal city... consider commuting if you get the job. 3) I work here. easy to live in SLC and there's a free train straight to UVU campus. all faculty get free public transit so it's easy to commute! 4). I also work here and commute in from SLC. I love living in SLC and the commute on the train is free and easy to do work, as it has wifi. There is a strong focus on work-life-balance here as well, which is nice. I'm also on the search committee if anyone has any questions! 5) @4: I will apply to this job since it looks like a good fit! How much does faith/religion affect teaching evolutionary concepts? Coming from OK/TX, I have some experience, but not sure how it differs in UT. 5) I don't work there but I do work in Utah and Mormons are actually fairly okay with evolution. It is taught at BYU and they modify some language around it like saying ""adaptation"" instead of ""natural selection"", but they seem to compartmentalize fairly well. I have a colleague who is non-LDS who teaches at BYU and he said teaching evolution has never really been an issue. The weirder thing is praying before faculty meetings (they don't do that at UVU thankfully). 6)@5, 4 here, I actually teach some sections of Evolution here, as well as teaching evolution in intro classes, and never really have much pushback. There's actually some great work by some in the department on the acceptance of topics and concepts that tend to be controversial, such as vaccines, evolution, climate change, etc. in our non-major introductory courses. Really cool stuff 7) A friend interviewed here last year and really liked the place and people. 8) Anyone have a sense of the entry level salary there? 9) @8 as it's a public university, salary information is available online for each faculty member through https://transparent.utah.gov/.

There's a lot of interest at SAIC in producing art majors that are engaged, well-rounded, and solve real-world problems. They're hiring a physical scientist as well. 4) does anyone have information about research capacity? I would be curious to hear a bit about what types of infrastructure and facilities are available, which obviously would have a big impact on what research a candidate might propose to do in lab classes or as their topic of study 5) Seems like a great place if you have collaborators at UChicago or UIC 6) I think it is unlikely we are going to get more clarification on this job from anyone in this forum. It's likely an email is needed for some clarification on things 7) Did anyone notice one of the writing samples needed is 2 example course syllabi? That is rather unusual, and not something I've seen in a job ad before 8) I have had to submit syllabi for TT jobs before 9) x3, and honestly it feels odd that this is uncommon. Teaching is typically 30-50% of the workload at many R1 institutions. Maybe they want to hire people who are actually qualified to teach? 6 again) I would again implore folks to email ahead. Seems like a teaching-focused or entirely teaching position to me. The previous ""biology"" teacher is an artist with a wikipedia page, not a scientist.

Curious what organismal courses they might need filled. 2) yes, someone [speciality removed -AP] is leaving. 3) Colby had another member in ecology leave a year or two ago, I wonder what's up with that. I know they moved on to a better gig, but wondering if Colby is not a great place to live or is a great launching pad to bigger and R1s. 4) this search is replacing someone who was denied tenure 5) @1, the ad says physiological ecology 5) I wonder how common tenure denial is here. Seems like many universities due it to save money 6) It seems easier to get denied tenure at elite SLACs because the bar is so high for teaching while you also can't slack on research. 7) What is the typical bar for research outputs at a place like that? Admittedly I haven't interviewed at any ""elite SLACs"", but I have interviewed at some and heard from folks at others and the most common response is that a single publication with undergrad co-authors by the time you go up for tenure is sufficient. 8) I interviewed at Colby last year. The expectation is more like 1-2 pubs per year. Some of the labs are shockingly large and productive for a SLAC/PUI (5-10 students, more during the summer). It's not uncommon for the more productive profs to leave for R1-type institutions. 9) Was FT temp faculty at Colby, a decade ago the tenure rate was about 2/3, which I guess is on the lower end. 10) can anyone speak to the expect sallary range? 11) 3 letters required upfront for the application 12) I really hate that people are trying to ""figure out"" why positions are opening, because some of these comments border on gossip. We shouldn't be telling peoples' stories without their consent. I get why people might want to know about a toxic climate, but outing someone for not getting tenure seems uncool to me. We just don't know what peoples' circumstances are. 13) Eh, I think it's important to know why a position is available. No one is named or outed here - that would violate the rules of the board. 14) @ 13 someone was outed in the initial comment by naming the specialty, and it looks like the mod deleted it. So yeah, that was not cool IMO. 15) Does anyone know if we are meant to submit a separate teaching and research statement, or one statement that speaks to both? The posting says one thing, then interfolio suggests another, and there's no contact info on the website. Also unsure of the length they are expecting... X3. 16) @15 Search committee member here. We are expecting a single file that has all three elements within. I am personally expecting to see for most applications about 2 pages each under headings (Research, Teaching, and Inclusive pedagogy). For example, the three separate files you are submitting for other similar institutions can simply be put together in a single doc/pdf. @5 I also want to clarify that we are looking for a population ecologist, or organismal ecologist (including physiological ecology), because we have a community ecologist in the department. 17) Interfolio is asking for letters of rec (3 required files), but the posting just asks for the contact info for references, should we submit a separate document for each contacts information? 18) I couldn't find a way to upload a file. I had to request the letters through Interfolio to be able to submit the application. 19) @15,16,17 Interfolio is asking for things separately or different than the job posting...any way to change the settings so we can give you what you want (i.e. one file with research/teaching/inclusivity and reference contacts) 20) @19 Apologies, this has just been fixed. If you've already submitted an application please don't worry, we'll deal with the discrepancy 21) @20 - thank you! x3 22) Zoom Interview Invitation 10/9 X2 23) Congrats! 24) So amazing! 25) On-campus interview invite 10/26","11","Match, exact","Colby College","ME",161086,"Waterville","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence","Not classified (Exclusively Undergraduate)","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Exclusively undergraduate four-year","Four-year, small, highly residential","Not Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Town Remote","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,651,0,0,0,0,651,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,569,82,0,0,2003,2196,2155,2155,2155,0,2155,0,0,0,0,0,566,0,8,0,NA,NA,15,45,NA,141,0.21659,37,0,0,0,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,0,0,0,2085,265,181,680,700,1380,31,29,29.811659,13922,1430,0.102715,3

We seek a colleague addressing pressing questions that advance our fundamental understanding of the ecology of agroecosystems while improving our ability to manage them sustainably. The Department of Land Resources & Environmental Sciences is a colleagial, supportive, and fun department with people working across a large range of fields within environmental science. Bozeman has a high quality of life, a vibrant mountain-town culture and arts scene, great public schools, and amazing access to the outdoors. Feel free to reach out to the search committee chair with questions (email address in job ad). 1) Does the University have a track record of supporting dual-career academic couples? 2) @1, I'd say the culture is very supportive of dual career couples and partner hires. Here is the official university policy: https://www.montana.edu/nsfadvance/documents/Partner%20Accommodation%20Department%20Heads%2012.2017.pdf . People will work very hard to make partner hires happen. As with many places though availability of resources for salary, startup, etc. can pose a challenge. 3) @ 2 thanks! I know it's challenging, but good to hear there is a record of support. 4) Just a general comment that cost of living in Bozeman has gottten extremely high. Median home price is about $950k; it was about $450k in 2014-ish. Outer communities of Three Forks, Livingston, Belgrade would be places to look for housing for whoever lands this. MSU generally does not pay that well, given the high cost of Bozeman. 5) any word? 6) We received >80 applications and have been going through them carefully.

I have no idea about this, would expect it to be low because its a freaking megauniversity. 2 again) I ask because most R1 EEOB dept have 1-1 teaching load, but Biology depts often have 1-0. So I'm wondering whether teaching load is lower here even in comparison with other R1s given that it's a Bio dept 4) teaching load is typically 1.5 (so one class every year, then either a co-taught course, or one run every other year). It's very reasonable! Also lots of microbial work here: https://www.huck.psu.edu/institutes-and-centers/microbiome-center 5) does anyone know who the search chair is or have an email we can contact with questions about the position? 6) Would Behavioral Ecology fall into the scope of the position? 7) It does say the broad field of Ecology so I would say that means open game for any level of Ecology but climate change is shouted out specifically @5) if you email the department head (https://science.psu.edu/bio/contact-us) she can pass along questions to the search chair 8) Am I doing somthing wrong? It seems that all I need to do to apply is to apload CV and answer some biographic qustions, no reserch statements etc. Am I missing somthing? @8) I think you upload everything together since it includes 'additional documents' and the job ad asks for additional things like the research statement 9) I don't see anywhere how many pages research/teaching statement is supposed to be, is it just assumed 2 pages each? 10) If there's no limits I think it's free for all.. I did 2-2-4 (research statement being 4 because I added the list of publications with some annotations as to why I selected those three pubs) 11) 3 pg. research, 2pg teaching, 2pg dei is my default if there are no explicit page lengths given 12) search closed or turned down? email says ""we are closing [the position] and will not be continuing in the recruitment process"" x5 13) TBH, pretty frustrating to ask people to put together applications and then cancel the search 1 week after the deadline... x3 14) Definitely disappointing.

Is there a SC member that I can email? 25) not to be negative, but I doubt it was reviewed unless you have some sort of inside contact. There are so many good applicants to a school like this that there is no need to review additional apps once they have distributed the applications to the committee. When I was on a search committee in the past when we got additional apps when never looked at them because we had already been assigned to review > 100 apps and had more than enough strong candidates so we didn't want to do the extra work for someone who didn't submit on time 26) Updates? 27) Still waiting here.

There are many amphibian species surrounding the university that never use bodies of water and their entire life history is on land. 8) Have to have a PhD at time of application? is this something I could reach out to the chairs about as I will have my PhD in December and believe I am competitive for this position? 9) @5, my interpretation (as primarily an organismal biologist) is that 'terrestrial ecology' is targeting an ecosystem-level perspective, not a organism/species/taxa level. x3 10) Maybe @8, but you may want to bark up other trees. Wellesley is in a very different category than many PUIs and unless you have an exceptional record you will likely be rejected from the jump. 11) Ad says PhD required at time of application and, although not stated in this ad, most top-tier liberal arts colleges require postdoc experience and/or a substantial record of reserach productivity post-PhD. 12) Yeah, as much as it sucks to say, anyone's chances of getting a tenure-stream position at a place like Wellesley right out of graduate school are extremely low. Never hurts to try though, it's good practice and will give you an excuse to work on materials you might have put off until later. 13) It's worth applying though. Some of these fancy SLACs really like to hire ABD grad students that they think are rising stars. I know several people who have landed at schools like Wellesley that way. 8) ya i think so too and thanks for the advice everyone! 14) @9 & @5, I disagree about the ecosystem ecologist, since they want someone to teach an organimal course and ecosystem ecologists tend to abstract organisms into pools/trophic levels. Typically, we use ""terrestrial"" to contrast with ""aquatic,"" and the latter has intellectual and methological histories and practices that differ from Ecology/ESA-type ecology, which is largely terrestrially-oriented. 15) Year 14 is how I think most jobs use the term terrestrial and to suppor that the previous ecology job here in 18-19 was advertised as 'aquatic ecology' 16) Terrestrial ecology CAN mean anything as long as it is not restricted to aquatics. You just need to demonstrate the breadth of knowledge required of an ecologist and sell yourself as the best candidate, oh, and look the part on paper. 17) Horrible application system. Letters required up front, but you can't submit the letter request until you submit all of your own material. 18) Yea, weird app site. I just pass on these extra effort postings unless it is really in an area I have some preexisting attachment to. 19) Does terrestrial mean they are wanting someone with a field component of their research or should quantitative/theoretical ecologists still apply? 19) Looking for some clarity on the LOR issue--does this mean letters are due 9/15? And that we should apply before then to give time for the letters to submit? Or do we think there's some flexibility on when letters come in? 20) reached out about the LOR confusion - HR recommends having letter writers send their letters to Working@wellesley.edu and then the letters will be manually added to your application packet after you formally submit everything. Ideally this reduces the stress of not giving your writers any way to submit something until the 15th (lol when most of us will actually submit our applications). But it does seem like the letters are due by the 15th... 19) @20 thanks for clarifying! 21) No diversity statement and a bizarre claim that gender = sex assigned at birth (weirdly called 'birth sex') gives me pause about DEI efforts. Can anyone speack to the culture at the institution re these decisions? 22) I don't actually even see an option to submit recommender information in the application? Update: The request for recommender info comes immediately after you submit. 23) Does anyone know WHEN on thr 15th the deadline is? 24) Has anyone heard from the search committee? Patiently waiting... x8 24) Zoom interview invitation 10/5 25) Good luck! 26) For those invited to zoom, what do you work on? x2 27) Did anyone else get a Zoom invite? 28) @ 27 zoom invite on 10/5 and @ 26---forest ecology 24) On campus invite 10/25","18","Match, exact","Wellesley College","MA",168218,"Wellesley","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence","Not classified (Exclusively Undergraduate)","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Exclusively undergraduate four-year","Four-year, small, highly residential","Not Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Suburb Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","Yes","No","No","No",0,713,0,0,0,0,713,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,659,54,0,0,2519,2735,2280,2252,2280,0,2237,23,1,19,0,0,581,0,12,0,NA,NA,16,45,NA,168,0.235624,39,0,0,0,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,0,0,0,2198,371,216,680,670,1350,31,29,29.735945,6581,1343,0.204072,3

This is an edge case between postdoc and permanent, but let's put such pipeline positions here for better visibility. - AP 2) Three reference letters upfront 3) Can someone explain to a non-American how these transition positions work? Don't you risk getting brushed off (or stuck) after the alleged post-doc period ends and never get to the TT-part of the job? I am asking because if I consider making (another) international move it has to be for a position that has a high probability of becoming permanant...hence why this hiring structure strikes me a s a bit odd, but it is probably because I am not familar with the US system. 4) @3, such positions are uncommon here, but are a relatively new mechanism designed to diversify the professorate. Technically open to anyone, but there's an emphasis on understanding the experiences of underrepresented groups. How likely is it to advance to a TT position is unclear and depends on the university, but at least its a prestigious postdoc that should open some doors somewhere. 5) Former UM postdoc: Most (if not all) of the presidential fellows I met at UM transitioned to tenure track jobs either at UM or elsewhere. I think some of them even negotiated startup, salary, etc... for the tenure track phase when hired as postdocs. 6) I recently interviewed for a similar program - THEY ARE AWESOME. Everyone gets promoted to TT eventually (some people linger as postdocs for longer though), but the postdoc period gives you time to learn about the department, finish up leftover papers from previous positions, and wrap your head around tenure requirements before the clock starts. 7) Is there a limit on the number of years after obtaining a PhD to be considered eligible? x2 8) When I go to the link it says they aren't reviewing until 12/24 and start date is 01/25. Just checked with committee and deadline is Aug 31st for materials to be submitted. Does the updated review date indicate a closer start date? 9) @8 I think there are two stages, one within SEAS to pick a candidate to apply at the university level 10) do you have to have a faculty member agree to support your application before applying? 11) Any idea when applicants hear back to know if they will apply for the broader fellowship? 12) Has to be well before 11/01 seeing at that is the campus deadline!

(2) yes.  Five teaching 'units' per year where a lecture/lab course is two units.  Class sizes rarely exceed 20 students. (3) does anyone have any intel on whether this is an internal hire? Looks like the department currently has a physiologist as a VAP (4) @3 you worry too much.  The only time an internal candidate has a significant advantage is if that individual is a spouse of an employee, hence placebound and often negotiated in previous hire.  Internal candidates have an advantage in that all the good points are seen internally.  HOWEVER, the disadvantage is that all the bad points are seen internally too!  If you are a VAP and looking for a perm job, you can not give 100% to the current position, or at least you shouldn't.  Some insitututions regualarly hire VAPs, others seldom or never do.  See how many of the current faculty were VAPs.  Probably next to none. The added advantage to a non-internal candidate is that they are the bright-shiny-new thing. Even if not better, they are shiny new.  Keep that in mind.  Also, if you look at your CV vs the VAP, you can make sure you call out things (without being obvious) that you definitely do or have done better than that candidate. An internal candidate is not something to be afraid of.  Most do not become permanent. (5) @3 and @4 I would tend to agree with @4, but I applied to a position at UR last year, got invited for a campus visit and full day interview with teaching presentation. Was praised highly by the dean for the narrative of my teaching statement. They eventually hired the VAP that had been there for 5+ years. So I think it depends. That being said, I agree with 4 that you should not worry too much or let it deter you from applying. Worry about your packet, not your competition. There are A LOT of scenarios that can play out. This is a gorgeous school and a great group of faculty. They are helpful, answer question thoughtfully, and treat their interviewees very well during campus visits! 6) I would say that, on average, internal candidates have an advantage simply as known entities.  But that rarely means they are a shoe-in - many candidates have their own advantages/elements that make them stand out. 7) baseless speculation as to whether this position is intended for an internal candidate--drink! 8) anybody heard from the SC? 9) references requested 10/9 x4 anyone heard anything since references requested? 10) campus interview invite 10/18 x4","4","Match, exact","University of Richmond","VA",233374,"University of Richmond","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Other-dominant, with Arts & Sciences","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Midsize","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,1027,104,0,116,0,1247,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,7,213,603,424,0,31,3914,4534,4056,3754.666667,3323,733,3136,168,1,18,467,266,787,24,34,20,NA,NA,20,52,NA,414,0.331997,41,8,3,0.073171,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,4,0,2875,482,329,630,650,1280,30,27,28.217016,12060,3727,0.309038,3

But it's a toxic environment in this dept, HK has its own issues politically, expectations to get tenure are Nature and Science papers. I'd think very carefully before making a move.4). Following on 3), do not apply, department is toxic-these positions are being advertised because people are leaving and others expected not to get tenure. 5) What is the salary for the Assistant and for the Associate positions? Folks here say 'high', but is there a number? 6) the numbers on glassdoor are correct. But there is no amount high enough to justify the toxicity and the damage taking one of these positions would do to your career. Do yourself a huge favor and *stay away*. 7) Can somebody post the salary? 4) (again) salary will vary based on the position, HK has high salaries so it will be higher than comparable jobs elsewhere. As 3 and 7 note- avoid it, it's seriously not worth it and these positions are only being advertised because they know people will leave, and many of the hires since 2019 have or will leave. Suggest reaching out to current staff (especially more junior staff) if you are considering applying- you should also likely read these for HK as a whole https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3251032/hong-kong-public-universities-record-new-high-academic-staff-departures-380-leaving-jobs https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/news/hong-kong/article/3251081/academic-staff-departure-rate-hong-kong-public-universities-highest-handover and for HKU other HK universities are getting enquiries from this department in particular about moving within HK for those with families who can't easily leave Hong Kong. 8) I was a previous faculty at another university in Hong Kong. I was there for three years. Salaries are rougly comparable among the UGC-funded eight Hong Kong universities. Here you can see the salary range at Lingnan Univ. https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/201805/23/P2018052300447_284322_1_1527071074119.pdf My salary was exactly around the mean salary given in page 2, and those of my colleagues were too. You usually get 20,000HKD as housing allowance in addition to that salary. Salary is really good, but recruiting overseas postdocs are very difficult (housing is too expensive), basic science is not well-funded, research space in HK is generally very limited, and PhD student quota is very limited (even if you have funding, it doesn't mean you can just employ them as many as you want). It's true that my department was really toxic and a lot of faculty left (including two deans), but I don't know whether HKU is toxic, and I cannot generalize that all universities in HK are toxic. Hong Kong universities are now under a very strong control from the mainland government, and university leaders are now mostly from mainland China. In general, you are expected not to make political statements there. I would say that the pro of HKU is that it is one of the best schools in Asia. The students there are VERY smart and has a very good pool of PhD candidates. I may consider applying to HKU, but I am very curious how toxic it is and whether they can provide decent space for research. 9) This department in particular is incredibly toxic, which likely caused the statements above. As they said, faculty are leaving this department for other HK universities because it is particularly noxious. It's true the undergraduate students are excellent, but undergraduate teaching is not valued. Space distribution is highly variable - some have excellent space and facilities, others are in conditions not conducive to conducting research. It seems to depend on personal relationships and stochastic factors. I would go to CUHK, CityU, HKUST over this particularly dire corner of HK.10). Yeah this department is very very toxic, and the housing allowance is lower than what is quoted above (about 12-14k for Assistant Profs, and 18 for Assoc profs), and may only last for the 1st few years someone comes to HK, plus assistant professors are not allowed to be in the staff housing as they are ""not senior enough"" (that housing is a bit more subsidised). If you are considering HK, go to South China-startups are likely higher and cost of living lower, plus many packages to attract international talent or literally any other HK uni, as many HKU staff are. Annual salary rise also likely below the rate of inflation. To be honest- this thread has at least 2 current members of faculty commenting-it is always wise to heed warnings of staff in a place, I would not recommend anyone consider joining this department at present, there is no space or support, and newer staff were all told misleading (erroneous) information during negociations, which is one reason one left in under a year. Also important to note, serious issues with health and safety in the workplace, constant construction for over a year, black mold round the building-including airvents, poor ventilation and regular noxious gases in corridors and some offices due to ineffective ventilation 11) Sounds like it's literally toxic! 12) 8 again. It's true that construction is being done everywhere endlessly in HK unis, making workplaces noizy and dusty all the time. 13). Yeah, every definition of toxic, and if we have important zoom meetings we have to just work from home as its so noisy (over a year of work on the building so far, including often drilling into walls above your head or behind you, or hammering metal-which noise cancelling headphones does not block), toxic chemicals, and no one with power cares about employee health or welfare. 14) Did anyone hear back? 15) Any information about start-ups of recent faculties? 12). Likely won't start shortlisting until August. Startups also went down, so about 1/2 of those in South China now- limit will likely be 2 million HKD, maybe lower (and yeah, anyone considering it is crazy given the warnings- the conditions literally make staff sick) ","2","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

""The successful candidate will not currently have primary employment within the state of Ohio."" I guess the 2024-25 season is officially open... (1) Wtf? So because I already live and work in Ohio, I can't apply? Wtf? (2) seems perhaps not very legal... 3) I love that the 'Ohio Eminent Scholar of Ecology' cannot be a current Ohioan. (4) sounds like a weirdo philanthropic requirement, like ""must bring talent to ohio"" 5) yes to what 4 says. Sometimes there are pots of money attached to these lines that have recruitment stipulation 6) There are Ohio Eminent Scholars in a variety of disciplines across Ohio's public universities. These positions were partially endowed by the state to help attract faculty from elsewhere. 7) I wonder what the endowment offers. 8) That is up for negotiation, previously that has included reduced teaching load, research funds, and other stuff. 9) updated link to submit application here: https://miamioh.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/miamioh-faculty/details/Associate-or-Full-Professor---Ohio-Eminent-Scholar-in-Ecology_JR100196 10) They are still looking for more applicants! 10) In person interview requested/scheduled.","2","Match, by alias","Miami University-Oxford","OH",204024,"Oxford","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Great Lakes IL IN MI OH WI","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Town Fringe","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,5139,898,67,0,0,6104,21808,2681,16,627,11,6,24,26,41,26,486,412,1971,3168,0,65,19716,21667,18880,17654.666667,16522,2358,16030,388,49,55,963,1395,3801,23,179,3,NA,NA,26,52,NA,1300,0.212975,86,55,35,0.406977,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,20,6,8179,1121,3154,580,580,1160,24,24,24,26844,24684,0.919535,3
