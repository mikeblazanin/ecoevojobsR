No wonder lecturers are on strike... 3)  UK immigration fees are an order of magnitude higher than other countries in Europe I've lived in. It's really hard here (UK) if you're coming from outside. 4) Does anyone know if this salary meets the minimum requirement for foreigners to apply for a skilled work visa? 5) @4 yes, but as @3 mentioned, the cost is quite a burden and many unis don't like to sponsor foreigners for financial reasons 6) Is it true that UK universities provide food/meals for faculty? I think that would effectively double the salary, if true. (7) Former post-doc at Lincoln here, and I know the Faculty well. To answer 6, no, you don't generally get food at UK universities - Oxford and Cambridge colleges will give you free meals, but that's very much an exception.

Happy to answer question! 1) As this is a 9 month role, what is the expected salary and do most professors take seasonal jobs in the summer or..? 2) @1, almost every tenure track professor job in the US is a 9 month role. You might be able to get extra money by summer teaching or grants, but usually people still work on their own research in the summer in order to meet tenure expectations. 3) @2 I think you might be misinformed. Many TT jobs are in fact 12 month appointments. It varies greatly from institution to institution. 4) The vast majority are 9/10 month contracts but virtually all of these have an option to pay out over 12 months. @1 in regards to salary, starting is ~ $64,000 for the 9 mo with NMU contributing 15.46% towards your retirement (~$10,000 annually).   5) @1, most TT jobs are 9 months paid over 12 months, super standard, so that you can get NSF summer salary 6) Yikes, 64k is so low! 7) Lower than most postdocs, but if housing is super-cheap in this area then it may be fine. I'm not familiar with it though 8) lol that would be a raise for me and I'm a third year asisstant prof :-(  x4 (second year but same!) 9) @1 thanks for all the information! Could you please clarify the '2 courses per semester' teaching load? The faculty contract says 24 credit hours per year (which I generally assume to be ~4 courses per semester). Wondering how you count '2 courses per semester' to get to 12 credits or if I am mistaken. 10) I am not associated with this search in any way, but consider cost of living - a $64,000 salary in Marquette, MI is equivalent to ~$150,000 in NYC. Plus a 15% retirement contribution is very generous. My impression is that salary could go very far in that location. 11) I wouldn't consider it generous. Look at the homes available around here on Zillow. There's not much available and much of it is really expensive or in disrepair.  12) @11 its the yoop dude. rural af. but lakeshore properies are inexpensive relative to the mitten (and elsewhere for that matter. 13) Amazing place to live, but yeah, that salary is somewhat low. 14) Well hell, I'll go ahead and apply if everyone's talking themselves out of it. Lake Superior is my favorite place on Earth x2 15) @14 shhhhhhh don't let the word out on how nice it is. Let them keep thinking its a frozen wasteland up there. x2 15) I'm also curious about the teaching load re:9. I was under the impression that NMU had higher teaching loads than 2 courses per semester. Along those lines, how are labs counted towards teaching load? 16) Search committee member here: @15 and @9: in the Biology Department we teach 2 classes/semester because we have graduate students (and undergraduates working in our labs), which brings us up to 24 contact hours per year. Faculty in the Biology Department has the lowest teaching load at NMU. Faculty typically teach the lectures and we have TAs teaching the lab sections and grading labs. During your first year you get a reduced teaching load (1 class per semester) and then in your second year you teach the full load (2 classes per semester). 17) @committee member: Can you speak to how references will be used for this applciation. I see names and contact info is required for three references. Will referees be contacted and expected to supply a letter to complete this application?

WTU can be bought out usually through funding by the college or external grants. -> anyone knows what this means? Sounds like a lot. 2) WTU = weighted teaching unit; usually 1 WTU per hour of lecture and 2 WTU's for each 3 hour lab. So a class with 3 hours of lecture where you taught one lab would be 5 WTU's. 1) Thanks! 2) I will also add that my CSU only does a 3 WTU course release for the first year (from 12 to 9), so 6 for the first two years is nice 3) so that would be 1.5-two classes per semester the first two years and 2.5-3 after that? That seems a lot for a research university 4) Not sure what you are thinking of in terms of a research university, but all of the Cal States have a pretty high teaching load. They are not R1s. 3) I had seen it as a R2 and was expecting less teaching - my bad 4) the default teaching load for a cal state is 4/4 (that's the 12 WTUs). If your dept chair is good at scheduling, that means you're spending about 10hr per week face to face with students. If your dept chair is unkind with scheduling and tries to absolutely maximize teaching hours (speaking from experience), you can easily wind up with 14-16 hr face to face with students via the use of labs and activity sections which do not carry as many WTUs per hour as lecture. Source: I worked at a cal state for a while and was on a curriculum committee so I saw all the ways WTUs get assigned to different class types 5) I'd also add that while you can buy out of courses, in my dept the max you can do is buyout of 6 units, so even if you do that you're still at a 2-2 course load.","","Match, partial","California State University-Fresno","CA",110556,"Fresno","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Single program-Education","Four-year, full-time, inclusive, higher transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily nonresidential","Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","Yes","No",0,5390,791,35,45,0,6261,8347,509,0,567,0,0,0,35,0,35,216,620,2640,2750,0,0,24298,26592,25497,22641,22704,2793,19297,3037,0,370,1916,877,3478,215,2233,542,NA,NA,26,52,NA,870,0.138955,58,41,27,0.465517,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,19,1,1139,3584,992,450,440,890,16,16,16,15448,13920,0.901088,1

""biophysics, cell and developmental biology, evolution and genome biology"". 2) How do these compare to CNRS positions in salary and conditions? 3) ""Upon their selection, successful applicants will then be expected to obtain research funding as well as a position with the CNRS or Université Paris Cité"": Is the research position with CNRS or UPC just a formality if you get the group leader position or would obtaining such positions be challenging? 4) Just a guess but this page doesn't even exist in French. So maybe that's the Institute trying to promote access to relevant foreign applicants by providing mentorship through the process of being employed in the CNRS or UPC (which is rather obscure, coming from abroad). The process will remain competititve but they will be hands on guiding the candidates. Maybe? 5) From what I understand in this ad, the selected candidate will have to apply for a CNRS position to obtain a salary. CNRS is very competitive and will not hire older candidates (~40+), although they will not say it because it is illegal. While there are other temporary grants that could pay for the group leader's salary for a few years, normally: no CNRS = no lab in France. 6) How is this even a job if you have to apply for another (competitive) job to get salary? I'm so confused. 7) it is very complicated to apply to the CNRS from abroad/as a foreigner, they are basically proposing to hold your hand through the process if you work in that area of expertise (that's how I understand it). 5) @7 Exactly. @6, yes, the French research system is odd. You basically need to secure two positions: one at the institution, and another one at the CNRS for the salary. The institute will provide lab space to the chosen candidate and help the candidate with the CNRS application. There is no guarantee that the CNRS will choose the same candidate, though. 8) This seems similar to the fellowship-to-faculty opportunities in the UK. If you get a big external grant, they let you start a lab. 5) @8 I am not aware of the UK system, but I think it's different as the CNRS is not a grant, it's your position and salary. It seems like in the UK you could start a lab as a fellow and THEN apply for funding. In France, if you don't land a CNRS position FIRST, you cannot even start your lab, as the institute will not pay for your salary, only the CNRS will (except for a few exceptions as stated above).","","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Positions are based in Port Aransas, TX, not in Austin. 2) Could anyone with recent experience at UTMSI comment on the current working environment at the lab in PA? Have heard some questionable things in terms of lab administration over the past 5ish years. 3) There has been turnover in the administration of the department and institute, which came with some hiccups. However, the faculty as a whole are great and there is tremendous potential. Low teaching loads, high research activity, lots of funding, and several future faculty hires beyond the current cluster hire. 4) They have a hard time retaining junior faculty - lots of turnover at junior levels due in part to issues identified by #2 but more generally lack of support by senior faculty. They've also had one or more failed dept/institute chair searches, so unclear what future leadership may look like. 5) what is grad student support like considering the distance from Austin? Are PIs expected to completely fund their students? That could contribute to poor retention of junior faculty in an uncertain funding landscape 6) I can speak as a previous graduate student at this institution. Graduate TA opportunities are minimal at best. There is a Semester by the Sea Program in the spring semester, that provides some TA funding. Nevertheless, most of the funding for graduate student support is through PI grants and student fellowships. However, there are a number department grants and university-wide grants that are accessible to students. 7) Following up on 6), graduate students at UTMSI are indeed largely supported by fellowships or PI-grants, but there are great safety nets within the department and university that ensure that all grad students are fully funded throughout their degrees. 8) Another MSI grad here, as long as students made adequate progress, the dept was very good about finding ways to support them, whether or not faculty have grants. The faculty who left around the time that I was there mostly didn't get adequate support from the admin or potentially issues finding good jobs for spouses if they weren't in marine science fields - the latter remains an issue, but I think the former has improved a great deal. 9) Following up on #8, I'm not so sure. One of the new faculty hired in 2021 has already left. The recent failed director search(es) leaves questions about the direction of the institute and future leadership as well. Not saying that, with the job market as it is, to avoid the place, but definitely do your homework and reach out to folks who've left if you can. 10) Just to correct some of this infromation, there has only been one failed director search (position was offered but declined by the candidate due to factors outside of the institute's control). One of the four junior faculty members who were hired in 2020 has left the department. 10) There seems to be a lack of direction from the higher administration due to high staff turnover and the current director, and living conditions in PA/ commute from Corpus are not ideal. Some faculty members often work from home (incluidng the one that was referred to in #10), and many of the graduate students are eager to leave.

The equivalent of assistant professor ('førsteamanuensis') has a very low threshold (i.e. you qualify with a PhD). As a result, generally, there is also a lower threshold for 'associate professor' here because you just need to thick some boxes (for instance, to be full professor you just need to supervise 2 students and have a bunch of papers). Last year in the U. of Oslo they hired an internal candidate with 2 published papers and 0 grants as an associate professor. So, clearly, the thresold is lower. 3) A friend who works in Norway thinks that it may be random - so as 2) describes or a more difficult. They said some people in Europe leverage on Norwegian offers with high salaries to bring offers back home, and some calls may be 'swarmed' with applicants who are already assistant professors.4) Assoc. Prof in Norway has a wider range than in US. Can be anywhere from 1 (rare!) to 10+ years post-PhD.

Wouldn't be the first internal candidate. 7) @9, I guess you don't like punk/metal? Uppsala is famous for it. x9001 11) This ad is so specific. They got to have someone in mind, don't you think? (12) I asked for the applicant list, 16 candidates. One internal candidate that checks all the boxes on sexual chromossome evolution and genome evolution. 13) wait you can just… ask for the candidate list? (14) Yes a lot of European universities will send this to you if you ask. (12 again) If your name is on it, by law, most Nordic countries have to share the list if requested. That's the rule of thumb. Anyway, the internal candidate is an assistant professor and a colleague told me that in Sweden (not all) assistant professors are permanent positions, suggesting this is a ear-marked promotion. 15) Ahh ok! This makes sense then. I honestly couldn't understand this ad. I fit the description perfectly so I applied anyway, but I couldn't figure out why they were looking for another person in this field at this level. It's also awkward to know that now there are potentially 15 other people who know I applied for this job in my little subfield...

I'm more self-conscious about my research, which is on land plants. I would happily switch to kelp forests though. Are you affiliated with the university? (3) No, I'm not affiliated, but I have interacted with people from the university through some of those programs. So I guess I'd say reach out to the search chair (not listed) and ask! It isn't totally clear from the ad what the independent research requirements are other than mentoring student research. 4) @2 I am at CSUMB will not be on the SC but I would say it is still worth appylying but you definitely want to show how you could integrate a marine focus moving forward and make sure your application materials don't look too terrestrially focused. You would be expected to teach marine classes and have a marine-focused research program. But we really want someone who really wants to be focused on the education/outreach programs so I would say it's still worth applying. 2) @4 thanks for the info!

Which is broad, and that was the point, but I can certainly see how our ad is confusing. In our defence, the Dean’s Office pushed hard for us to narrow the vision and connect this position more tightly to our undergraduate program. With that pressure, we are now expecting the successful candidate to be able to teach a couple of our molecular genetic intense courses, of which we have a half dozen to choose from. An evolutionary biologist (especially a comparative biologist) could fit the bill. Now that we are past the Dean’s Office and Provost quibbling about our ad, the committee will take seriously a strong candidate that is not a tight fit to the job ad.

OP) Please see the first thing I posted. 5) Any chance this is for an internal hire? 6) People on this board are entirely too concerned with the internal candidate bogeyman. Apply! 7) Certainly seems like there is a VAP who is a very good fit. @6, people are just as concerned with scolding anyone for ever mentioning internal candidates. 8) Maybe the internal candidates are posting there is an internal candidate to scare away competition 9) maybe the **external** candidates are posting there is an internal candidate to scare away competition (cue this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHjFxJVeCQs) 2) Seeing a VAP who's a good fit for an open position could also mean ""the VAP is leaving and we need someone similar"" 10) that isn't how VAPs work. x2 11) @10 it can be if they were hired to temporarily cover a position until a TT line was approved 10) @11, that isn't what the previous comment said. No department says 'welp, our VAP is leaving us time to just hire a TT line in the same field'. Of course VAPs are hired to temporarilyl cover positions until TT lines are approved, but that is a completely different order of events. 12) At the risk of jumping the gun, has anyone heard anything? 13) Nothing here as of 11/18 x4, 14) haven't heard anything as of 11/28. anyone else? 12) Nope, still nothing x4 15) Nothing as of 12/6 x3 16) Nothing as of 12/12, Committee wyd 12) Letters requested 12/19 x3","9","Match, partial","St Lawrence University","NY",195216,"Canton","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Education-dominant, with other professional programs","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, small, highly residential","Not Classified","Mid East DE DC MD NJ NY PA","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Town Remote","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,702,26,0,0,0,728,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,26,593,109,0,0,2434,2554,2319,2283.666667,2280,39,2249,7,0,24,17,22,571,0,25,0,NA,NA,17,45,NA,183,0.251374,29,4,0,0,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,2,0,2372,241,96,590,590,1180,28,24,25.139466,5952,2813,0.472614,3

The school seeks candidates to teach primarily undergraduate courses in general biological topics and in their area of expertise. The typical teaching load is the equivalent of 9 credits per semester. The successful candidate is expected to develop an active, independent research program involving mostly undergraduate students and to seek external funding. Their research should result in peer-reviewed dissemination of work. A small master’s program provides additional student opportunities. 1) Does the University of New England have a research greenhouse? 2) 9 course hours seems like a lot (in addition to starting/running a lab). Can you give an example of what 9 hrs looks like? 3) @1 Yes, there is a small indoor greenhouse attached to the science building, which could be used for research but it is currently not being used. 4) @2, In general, typical teaching loads for TT faculty might be 2 lectures (different section, same course), ranging from 5-24 students per section, and 1 lab section (up to 24 students). Or it could be one lecture, 2 labs of the same course. Other loads might be 2 lectures of two unique courses, developed by the faculty member, and they might have a lab component. It varies. I would suggest requesting a course release for your first or second semester while getting your lab started. 5) @4 Thank you! Really helpful. 6) Any updates? 7) nothing yet...but I might be one of the unlucky ones 8) Any updates (12/13)? 9) As of 12/15, invitations for zoom interviews have not been made, but it is expected to begin in January 10) So, if my references have not been contacted yet, I can assume I'm out of the running? 11) Im not on the SC, but have heard reports from SC and no, they have not contacted references yet either.

Everyone has their own idea about what it means and never checks to see if it matches what other people think. 4) Yeah, I see ""applied avian ecology"" and think bird pest control in vineyards, lol 5) Applied almost always means agricultural or management focused, *especially* when the position is advertised out of a Natural Resources department. 6) what @5 said plus they explicitly say they are looking for a research program ""consistent with the land grant mission of UNH and New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station"" x2 7) I don't think that's true 5. Probably true when it comes out of a natural resources department, but more broadly there is a lot of variation in what people mean by applied. Often people just means conservation oriented (without necessarily a direct management focus) rather than basic science oriented. That seems to be the definition being used in this advertisement. x2 8) you can see the type of reseach faculty do here: https://colsa.unh.edu/new-hampshire-agricultural-experiment-station/research#collapse_12068 9) Interested internal candidate exists 10) @ 9 tryna scare ppl away from applying... 4) I heard the last people to apply for a job here GOT EATEN BY SLENDERMAN (the internal candidate), y'all should probably steer clear X3 11) SC member here. There is an internal candidate but this is a fully open search - we want the best person! It is a great department and great position. The wildlife major in the department is thriving. The ""applied"" part is as described above - related to the AES/land-grant mission not necessarily constrained to a particular subdiscipline. 12) Slenderman is a lot like an internal candidate, in that if you believe in him he becomes real. 13) non-white applicants - definitely look into the area. Finding BIPOC community can be difficult. 14) SC member here again. The area is fairly homogenous (80-90% white). UNH is a bit more diverse than the surrounding areas and has demonstrated commitment to DEI - here is some info/stats on diversity and DEI activity at UNH: https://www.unh.edu/diversity-inclusion/sites/default/files/media/2023-10/22_23_unh_ddei_ar_.pdf. Boston is about 1 hour south of campus. We encourage all interested candidates to apply and look into the area! 15) Question for SC: I applied today 11/13 and was confused about references. Job post says three letters to an email address, but the application itself just asked for references. Are letters needed now? 16) Not on SC, but somewhere in the job ad it specified an email address to have your letter writers send their letters into. My understanding was they were requesting to have them emailed in now with your application. x3 17) SC member here: yes, please send letters via email. Sorry for any confusion. 18) Any updates? 19) None as of 11/30 x4 (20) None as of Dec 5 x3 21) Another week and still nothing... anyone else?  22) Zoom invitation 12/11 x5   23) On site invitation 12/22 24) Really @23? How is that possible that they already got university approval? 25) Darn. Not 23, but it seemed that zoom interviews ended on the 20th. I guess they could have met that day and asked for approval, gotten it on 21st, then sent invites.

Yep, application requires answering some values questions related to the Fransican sponsorship. The university staff/faculty include folks from all faith traditions (including none), and these values are extremely broad, e.g. ""Peace and Justice"" and ""Responsible Stewardship"". I've judged this document as the university's way of assuring that they are hiring people who at least reflect on moral issues and can talk about them in the classroom.  Second, yes the political science program was removed last year. Faculty voted against it, seemed like a very complex issue involving some big personalities that I can't really speak on. However, admin is very determined to shape offerings in order to best match their aggressive strategic plan, which is tough to retort since enrollments are climbing and more and more investments are being made in buildings and successful majors/programs. Place is not struggling financially in the broad scheme of things and biology is a big part of uni's goals. Lastly, the students who I know well and represent a multitude of diverse groups seem to feel supported and especially value their close relationships to professors. Am I 100% morally aligned to upper admin and board? Absolutely not (is anyone though?).

What the heck. At #5 the resl problem is when they do'nt even get back to you after in person. See the Gen discussion tab for some fun rants on this. *5 again*) That's even worse (i.e., ghosting a finalist, after a campus visit). If that happened to you, I'm sorry; that's awful. 3) yep #5 has happened to me and many others. It's incredibly rude IMO. 3) Refs contacted, but I assume that was automatic after applying x3 6) Not sure—the platform said that requests went out for my application, but my references don't seem to actually have received anything. So maybe not automatic? 7) In the reference request status part of the portal, for me it says 'Recommendation solicited' and the time stamp is exactly when I submitted the application. I can confirm that my references did receive a push for letters. 8) some requests for letters went to spam inboxes so have your people check there! 9) anyone recieve any updates? 10) nope 11/20 11) STill nothing here 12/7 x3  Are they going to post this job once a year just for fun but not hire anyone? 12) I heard they did hire someone last year but they backed out for a different offer - still haven't gotten notice on that app (over a year ago!)","4","Match, exact","Providence College","RI",217402,"Providence","Master's Colleges & Universities: Larger Programs","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Education-dominant, with Arts & Sciences","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Not Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Midsize","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",1,1112,232,0,0,0,1345,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,15,217,481,631,0,21,4618,5254,4821,4469,4298,523,4091,151,7,49,195,328,996,4,55,30,NA,NA,21,52,NA,570,0.423792,40,11,6,0.15,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,5,0,3243,441,140,610,600,1210,27,25,25.481928,10817,5826,0.538597,3

Last year's search was successful, but we continue to need folks in this area, so we are searching again. This year we're looking for people who develop (and apply) cutting edge quantitative methods in EEB. If you applied last year and develop quantitative methods, consider applying again. Integrative Biology and Plant Biology are both possible home departments. Feel free to ask more here! 2) Hello! Would someone who does evolutionary genomics be a good fit for this position or are you looking for someone more theoretically oriented?  SC) @2 Yes, ""all research areas within EEB will be considered"". 3) What qualifies as ""cutting-edge"" quantitative methods? New statistical methods?  4) Would the development of phylogenetics / genomics pipelines satisfy the quantitative methods requirement?  SC) @3-4 we're looking for something beyond routine application of existing methods. Phylogenetics and genomics are within the scope of EEB. 5) Any updates? 6) it's been like 3 days. I figure they got swamped with apps so it'll be at least a week or two before updates roll in. 7) I thought for sure some info would come out this week. Anyone heard anything? 8) Based on the similar job posted at MSU last year, it may still take a while. Last year applications were due 11/15/22, letters were requested on 1/27/23, and on-campus interview invitations were 2/24/23. 9) I keep coming here and reading ""interview invitations were..."" in the last message and having a heart-attack, so I'm just going to change it. No news as of 12/5. 10) haha sorry about that @9 😂 11) Good point (8). Early fall rumor mill was they wanted to get interviews in this calendar year. Clearly I need to be more realistic and update my daydreams. *SIGH* 12) Managing expectation is important given other rumors about this search (x2) (13) What are you talking about @12? Seems like unfounded speculation. 14) ok if everyone is going to start mentioning rumors I demand be filled in (x2) 15) interview invite 12/11 16) Thanks for the update! (17) @15 did they request your letters already or just go straight to in person interview? 18) Letter requests and interview invite at the same time 19) I'm curious what these rumors were about that @12 mentioned. Would you mind clarifying? 20) Not 12, but I've heard this search was for two candidates interviewed last year (x4) 21) Ah I see, thanks for that info (22) Email saying they are interviewing four people, I am on the 'reserve list', and also asking to submit reference letters. (23) That seems very weird and somewhat... cruel? 24) @23 I'd rather be on the reserve list than not. x3 25) Yeah agree with that @23 and @24.

This one is at the St. George campus - they hire separately. 5) There was a successful ""computational biologist"" search initiated in the fall of 2020 at St. George 6) the search mentioned in (5) hired a computational evolutionary biologist. I guess that is the reason why this seach focused on ecology. 7) The different campuses search, interview, and hire independently; undergrad teaching is also independent on the 3 campuses. There have been no previous searches in computation ecology for this department and campus. If you do anything remotely computational or statistical, apply! 8) I wonder if they would only look at applications that are purely computational, or would there be an opportunity to be predominantly computational but also have a wet lab / or field program? 9) In reply to (8): as faculty in this dept, though not on the search committee, my instinct is that computational + wet lab or computational + field would also get looked at seriously. You don't get any of the jobs that you don't apply for. You also have no way of knowing the research foci of the rest of the applicant pool; it may be that many applicants have this research profile. Make sure your research and other statements emphasize the computational aspects of your work. 10) Some departments, apparently, will strongly look down upon applicants that apply mulitple years in a row. I'm considering not applying to wait until I have a stronger CV, of course at the risk of there not being an appropriate hire in the future. I had two questions -- are searches in this department typically targeted? And secondly, I wonder if this would be one of those departments that would still look at an application in subsequent years? 11) In reply to (10): if you think you'd like a job here, apply now and whenever there's an opening that's plausibly relevant. Your profile and c.v. will change over years; search committees almost always turn over for every search;  the applicant pool changes dramatically as well. Apply any year you want, and don't worry about applying multiple times... the search committee looks at 100s of applicants per search, and there's unlikely to be any memory of ""s/he/they applied last year""-- interviews might be a different story, as there's more collective memory.  We look at all the applications, for every search. Not sure what you mean by ""targeted""-- some ads are broad (""ecology"" or ""evolutionary biology""), some are focused in specific areas (""computational/statistical ecology""). Depends on departmental plans, retirements, growth opportunities, joint positions with other units, etc. Hard to forecast all that, so just apply if your work is relevant. 12) I think (10) is asking if the department generally has a person in mind when they put out this or other job ads. 13). In reply to (10) and (12): no, we don't have individuals in mind when we post ads for open searches. 14) are reference letters requested from only one of the reference writers named? (that's what is happening for me so far). 15) @14...when I applied all 3 went out. Did you submit the application recently? Sometimes the system takes several hours to send them out to the referees. 16) I think it's just that I didn't get all the notifications, somehow, but my 3 references confirmed they received the invitation to submit anyway, so it's all good! :) 17) Curious if anyone has insight into the timeline for this search, or thoughts on whether we should expect an update before the holidays? 18) IMO I think it's too soon before the holidays to expect any updates 19) campus invitation 12/14 x2 20) @19 so invites have went out already? 21) On-campus interviews have been scheduled (4 people invited) 22) Congrats and good luck!x3","12","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Take some of the NSF funds for conservation genomics and let USFWS keep their money for population monitoring and habitat protection.  Otherwise that comp bio money will go to other nerdy things with no conservation impact at all. NSF funded climate science isn't the thing solving climate change. But it's necessary to know what to do with climate change. 9) SC chair here - @2 It's a completely open search.

However, interfolio is requiring the three references. (2) why does this same discussion of references come up for every application? interfolio can require the information without immediately contacting the references. The search committee wants to gather the information for if/when they decide to contact them so they can act quickly. 3) @2 because we all over-think things. (4) I think 1 might have a point. Normally you can just upload a single PDF to interforlio with all the references, but interfolio asks for 3 different files. Seems like an error in how the page got set up. I guess one could upload three PDFs each with contact info for one reference?! Not very efficient, but will satisfy the system. (5) I'm sure it depends on how it is set up. i've had to submit a pdf with references and fill out the individual contact information into forms on interfolio for a single application and still the references were not contacted until later in the process. (6) Search Chair here: We do indeed only want the contact information at this point. Looking into setting up the interfolio to make that clearer. If you submit your application before then, adding the same file with three contacts three times would work to get the system to submit. [UPDATE: This is fixed now, you will only be asked to enter contact information for references -- SC] 7) @6 - Awesome, thank you SC! x4 (8) How many recent hires in EEB in this dept have been postdocs? (9) I'm always confused by review date. Does review date mean that for full consideration you need to have all materials in by 11/5? Interfolio doesn't list any dates as far as I can tell. 10) I'd just submit at this point. If it says review begins I normally submit the night before, but it's probably splitting hairs. 11) submitted this morning. fingers crossed. at least 300 apps with quite a number of APs? 12) @ 11- where did you get the ≥300 application figure from? are you estimating from the ""number applied"" column here? 13) @ 12. yes, that's my guess. at least 10x the number. 14) the WSU job had a similar number and got around 300 applicants.

It is fully open to any applicant that feels they may meet the basic criteria. It is open to any animal taxa not limited to birds. The AFAR is a globally unique facility that could or could not be used by the candidate. We are simply looking for an established researcher in order to meet the CRC Tier 1 requirements.

Miami is not exactly an affordable place to live in SC) The salary is negotiable and will depend on rank and qualifications. Miami is expensive, but UM is private and generally pays well. 2) any idea who the search chairs are for this? I couldn't find info on the website 3) EEB search chairs are Kenneth Feeley & Amy Zanne. This dept is also running an MCB search, chaired by Kevin Collins. 4) Miami is also unaffordable for potential grad students, and it looks like the base stipend is $24,950. I see the Dean's Fellowship approaches a livable wage of 35K. How easy is it to secure that for grad students in a lab? 5) Jeez, $25k in Miami is ridiculous. SC) The grad student stipend has been increasing and is now at ~$30k for 9 months - so close to $40k if you pay summer salary.  And you are allowed to pay grad students' summer salaries with your start up. Health insurance is covered 100% for all grad students. Unlike many other universities, UM Biology does have lots of TAships available for grad students (and lots of internal fellowships) and we guarantee 5-years support for all grad students. 6) @SC that actually seems like a great deal for grad students! Kudos, UM! 7) Does UM also offer housing subsidies for new faculty members? A quick Zillow search shows that housing prices around UM typically exceed $1.5M. SC) Housing is expensive (bubble ready to burst?) but salaries are fairly high. If you are able to commute a short distance (by car, bike, or public transport - yes, Miami does have a working metro), you can of course find much cheaper housing than what is right around the university. UM does not offer any housing subsidies for new faculty, but we have been pushing for it. SC) Update on graduate student support - for what its worth, a senior administrator just announced unofficially that we should be expecting a very large increase in grad student stipends. 8) Thank you, SC, for sharing this information. Could you please provide a timeline for this search? SC) applications are due this weekend (10/15) and we hope to start reviewing files, formulate a short list, and request letters asap, with interviews in mid to late January. We would like to have someone starting August 2024, but start date is negotiable. 9) someone please be kind enough to put me out of my misery as soon as you hear about references or zoom (x3). 4 again) Big thanks to the SC for your response! 10) Letters requested 11/1 x12 11) Any chance the SC member is still checking and could let us know approximate number who had letters requested? Just wondering if it is still a very long list or if I should get my hopes up. 12) I just realized that 6 letters were requested at the time Im reading this, and there are 6 folks who logged themselves as having applied to this position. Curious about numbers of applications too. 13) Was the nortification about the letter sent to the applicants? If so, I was not selected... 14)Yes, the notification was sent to the applicants 15) :'( this is so brutal x3 16) Thanks for letting us know. Congrats to long list folks. x3 SC) We received 250 very strong applications and sent out reference letter requests to 35 pre-tenure candidates.  At this time we are focusing primarily on ""junior"" candidates, but we are actively working on adding more mid and senior level candidates to the list so we may still be requesting letters from additional candidiates in the future.  17) thanks for the transparency, SC, much appreciated. But wow I didn't even make the top 35? That's a reality check. Ouch. SC) It was an extremely strong and competitive applicant pool and our selections were made based on many different factors, meaning that lots of really great candidates didn’t make the cut. (36) 250 strong applicants for 2 jobs is a tragic statement about the overproduction of phds in our field. 19) Absolutely. But 250 is not too many compared to some jobs. Duk advertised two positions last year and got over 550 applications, and I've heard of others (maybe Michigan last year) getting closer to 1000! (20) Yeah UMich was around 850 IIRC 21) 250 is definitely low for an open search like this at a really nice private research uni. Very low. I would guess that if this number is a result of the ""Florida effect."" Even though Miami is somewhat insulated as it is private, FL is a wasteland for top academic applicants on the job market because of the political environment. 22) any updates from those who had letters requested? 23) Some of those comparisons are pretty extreme outliers. 600+ for even a pretty broad ad is unusual. That U Washington cluster across many departments for 5 positions a couple years ago had ~1200. 250 seems a little low, but I think 3-400 would be very normal for a job like this. I know people want to avoid Florida, but people also need jobs... 24) Any update 11/28? 25) Haven't heard anything 11/29 x 5 SC) We are still reviewing letters and hope to send out interview invitations soon.  26) Thank you, SC.

Never understand the logic of this question. Searches fail all the time for mundane reasons. Top candidate dragged feet then declined and Dept was not allowed to make second offer, etc. Failed searches do not signify disfunction or malfeasance 4) I'm not @2, but basic curiosity seems like pretty obvious logic to me. x6. 5) I don't know if the search failed or not. I do know that they went through two rounds of in-person interviews last year, offered the job to people that went elsewhere, and did not offer it to the remainder. I know of people that had a bad experience last year and have still not heard anything back. 6) Here's a basic reason to want to know if a search failed: If I get this job will I have a colleague that started the year before that I can get some immediate mentorship from? 2 here) Curious because last year I didn't even get a zoom interview - and so I might not waste my time again (I know, I know, the pool is different). And if 5 is right, kudos to them for going back into the pool, but that seems to just reinforce my reasoning.  7) Many departments, if they make a new hire, publizice on websites, X (formerly twitter), etc, so not too difficult to determine if someone new has started 8) Search is a repeat, but refreshed in scope.

(1) Probably  2) Looks like rolling application consideration.  Not necessarily short. It would be helpful if an SC member could confirm. (3) wasnt there a similar job post a few years ago? Did that search fail? (4) Yes, that search failed. (5) SC member here. Evaluation of applications will actually begin OCTOBER 6--it took a bit longer than usual to get this posted becasue of new NY laws to post salary range.  6) Thanks SC! x3. 7) Shouldn't this new deadline be updated on the job posting? 8) already 3 applied dang it is going to be a popular one. anyone know about the salary? seems low for NYC but some bay area ones have discussion about the range not being a real range, same here? (8) Should the app be addressed to anyone in particular? 9) this was a listing last year for the same job IIRC. Also--I'll just say it here cuz I applied in the past, but they required a DEI statement but as far as I can tell nobody in their department has lifted a single finger on a DEI initiative--I searched the website for hours and found nothing. Makes writing this statement a huge burden. (10) To SC member - can you share any info about the SC's feeling towards pre-tenure assistant professors vs straight outta postdoc applicants, if there was any discussion about that? (11) @10 All schools like this will favor pre-tenure asst profs no matter what they say in response. (12) 10 here - not necessarily, they can be harder to convince to move depending on the situation 13) @10, I would guess Columbia is in a position both in prestige and location that they don't worry to much about having to convince applicants to move to them. (14) @11, can you share why you think a school like this would favor a pre-tenure asst prof over a postdoc? (15) I think they probably worry - area is expensive, crowded, and salary is potentially meh. someone with a TT spot in a smaller town might ask for a lot of resources (personal and professional) to make the jump. (16) For the statement about increasing diversity, has anyone focussed on B-diversity (eg differences in species numbers between populations) or just talking about alpha-diversity (species richness)? I submitted mine with only alpha but am worried I should have went broader (17) Anyone know who the search chair is? (11 again) @14, these schools have strong programs only because they have the funds to recruit people who have demonstrated success elsewhere. they don't take risks (18) does anyone know how distinct the E3 department is from the rest of the Biological Sciences department? It seems like a lot of evolution poeple are over in the other department and the focus of this department is quite narrow (19) @18 - I did my PhD in E3B at columbia - it was very distinct from the rest of the BIological Sciences (most definitely a completely separate department in every practical sense).  It did have really awesome ties into the consortium institutions (places like WCS and the American Museum of Natural History).  Also had very close ties to earth sciences at the Lamont campus.  Cool dept, super smart faculty. (20) has anyone received a zoom invitation? (21) nothing here x16. (22) Reference letters requested x7 (23) Said they were requesting letters from the top 10% of applicants, then moving straight to in-person interviews, so no zoom stage. (24) Was this letters email straight to the candidates? (25) @24 Yes, emails were sent directly to applicants and to references (26) @25, Thanks for the info. Another one bites the dust! x4 (27) Surprised this is taking so long... (28) Any updates, SC? (29) Were shortlist invitations already sent out? Asking on 12/05. (30) Nothing here 12/8 (31) Nothing here 12/11 x3 (32) In-person invite late in the day on 12/11 x3  33) Rejection 12/12 x3 (34) Neither rejection nor invitation x3 35) @34 I got that in a previous year.  I think it meant I was on the backup list.  Unless it meant you had an incomplete app.  (34 again) I had a reference request, thanks for info! 36) Neither rejection nor invitation people, should we ask? (34) Nah, just assume we're rejected.

It would be great if the SC can explain more here, thanks. (7) nice to see UT can still swing a DEI search with the political climate of texas. kudos to cmte for passing the GOP smell test x2  8) It really isn't that hard to do, and it's often part of grant writing.  Global Warming -> Climate Change;  DEI -> Mentorship and Student success. 9) @6 I don't understand - you applied for this job previously and got that email? 10) This is a new search, not a failed search from a previous year 11) Does this job have different tenure requirements? Or is this just a way to add more pre-tenure work to someone who shoulders a lot of mentorship/DEI burden? 12) I'm on the SC; @2 and @3 are correct, the search is broad in terms of research focus. @4 and @5 No, the emphasis on mentoring is meaningful, that said even though we are not allowed by law to use certain terms, the department is committed to a climate that includes everyone. @10 you are correct, this is not a failed search from a previous year. @11 college & department both value mentorship and yes, it is considered in T&P.  (13) This world of 'asking for DEI statements while also not failing the GOP smell test' is a special kind of hell! 14) Agree w/13, and ""even though we are not allowed by law to use certain terms"" is so dystopian. (Not a dig at the SC, appreciate all the effort you're going to to make this work!) x3 15) Well...fudge. Uploaded all my documents on time but didn't click ""submit"". Rookie mistake. 16) @15 I doubt anyone will notice you're a day late – submit it! 17) it looked to me like the system was set to lock at midnight on the 30th. But maybe 15 could email the application materials in? (18) rejection email 19) @ 18, when did you receive this? (18 again) oops wrong UT search, that was for the plant one. No updates on this one. 20) letters requested x13 21) Did you get notification that letters would be requested, or did one of your letter writers let you know? 22) I did not get a notification, my writer let me know x12 23) Any updates?

Vision statement = research statement. BI statement = DEI statement. Having 3 published papers to attach as reprints should be easy. Cover letter and CV are standard job packet components. x2 4) I like the vision statement (despite the cheesy name). The instructions are very clear about what that document should contain, moreso than for most research statements.x3 5) Have to agree. Sometimes the top tier schools are pretty agregious but this seems like a fancy way of describing the standard materials. 6) That vision statement request is pretty different from nearly every research statement I've read x2 7) I guess this answers the question from the Venting Tab, ""Who determines the standard?"" 8) Is this worth applying to for folks who study evolution? 9) In their last round, lots of people were notified as 'tier 1' applicants who then somehow were not interviewed - is there any point in re-applying, or does this mean that those folks simply did not meet the search criteria and should let it go? 10) How many is ""lots of people""? From the message I saw, it read as if there were only ~10.. 11) @9, if the last search had a different focus, worth reapplying. Also worth reaching out the SC if you made the long list but weren't called to see if you fit for this search. (like x1) 12) Is this worth applying if i dont have a CNS paper? 13) @12 tbh no, look at who got hired last time and make your decision that way. 14) CNS isn't required, but a previous stint at an Ivy, specifically Harvard, definitely helps. 15) It's an open rank position. They may be hiring someone with tenure, so I think it's reasonable for them to ask for a little more in the way of an application. 16) GREAT department. Lofty goals, but the support and community to enable it. 17) anyone know the geographic area? whats it like living there? 18) I was a grad student at Princeton and found it to be a really nice place to live. Lots of convenient amenities on Route 1, but also a lot of nice ruralish green space. ~1 hour from both Philadelphia and New York. Some faculty lived in Princeton proper, others a bit further away in other townships. Seems like a nice place to have a family, but students/postdocs/faculty who were more into big city settings found it a bit quiet. 18) close to the ocean too (45 mins). 19) For those interested, there will be a Q&A webinar hosted by the search committee on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, at 12 PM EDT - https://princeton.zoom.us/s/95659402367 no registration required. 20) @12 - I'd worry less about not having a CNS paper and more about not having a PhD from an Ivy League school. Just saying. 21) seems like I've seen different posts for this job. Why does the job ad say eco-evo-behavior but social media and colleagues are saying behavior only? That seems like a bait and switch if true and misleading by others if false. Is there some political battle about which faction gets this search? @19 where was this zoom advertised? Is it definitely open to anyone? 22) the zoom is put on by the department/search committee. They did the same with their evolution post last year. It is open to anyone interested in applying 23) Am I reading this posting correctly that there is no teaching statement? 24) Curious as to what kind of information could this Q&A possibly contain? I'm not applying so won't attend, but am sincerely interested in what purpose this serves. I suspect to reassure everyone to drop their preconceived notions about what gets you hired there? 25) I think that the reason Universities started doing these webinars is to try to make the application process more accessible to diverse groups. 26) I see the application asks for contact info for references. Do we know if refs are contacted when we apply/if letters requested up front? 27) @26 and everyone, it was just stated during the webinar that letters ARE requested upfront by the Oct 25 deadline. 28) Letters can arrive past the deadline, as was stated towards the end of the webinar. The application with contact info for references has to be submitted by the deadline. 29) Was the Zoom recorded and will it be posted for those who couldn't attend? 30) To the best of my knowledge, the zoom Q&A was not recorded. 31) I was in the webinar, and it was definitely recorded (the little red recording indicator was in the corner of the screen). Maybe there are HR reasons for not posting it though? 32) Letters requested at the time of application. 33) Anyone ask in the Q&A about the lack of a teaching statement? First time I've seen that, and I'm wondering if I should even drop my teaching info from my cover letter... 34) Is anyone able to see the status of their recommendation letters? When I click the link emailed after submission, I don't see any change to that area so I'm not sure how we tell that letter requests have been sent out. x2 35) Clicking the link provided, under each name I can see if the letter was submitted or not (either ""Waiting for response from reference."" or ""Recommendation has been provided.""). It takes a few days for requests to be submitted, so if you just submitted the application this might be the reason of not seeing the updates. 36) @33 - If memory serves, they mentioned in the Q&A that the ""Broader Impacts"" document would be the place to mention teaching. 37) Letter writer indicated that they didn't get a prompt yet after I submitted my application. They're ready, and waiting for the email request. 38) In my case it took 3 days. 37) Thanks @38. I guess it's maybe not automatic then. 39) Do we assume the deadline is midnight EST or will midnight West Coast be OK? 40) No idea @39. I always assume the time zone where the posting was made, if there is a hard cutoff, which sometimes isn't clear. Good luck! 41) I read the above, but am still not clear about letters of recommendation. It sounds like they are auto requested a few days after the application is submitted, but when are they due for full consideration? not sure what deadline to tell my letter writers here. 42) I don't know what to tell them either, I hope that the information is in the email that gets sent out to them. 43) I remember during the webinar they said it's ok if the letters arrive a week past the deadline. I would send them in asap. You can read last year comments on a position within the same department (row 993). 44) Submitted before the deadline, but letter writers still haven't gotten requests -- anyone else in the same boat? x6 45) Mine letter requests happened as soon as I submitted, with confirmation from my letter writers to submitted them ASAP. I don't know why it wouldn't for everyone else?x2 46) My letter requests were sent after a 3-day delay, like others mentioned. Found out from one letter writer that they got it today. 47) as a letter writer I am confused - am I supposed to send the letter now, or was this just for contact info? 48) @47 - I believe you are supposed to submit the letter now. The search committee wants letters for all applicants. 49) Any updates? 50) in the Zoom info session, they said the following about timeline: first Search Committee reads all applications and ranks them. The top ~1/3 will be read by the entire faculty, who will shortlist 5-7 people for interview. They said everyone should hear whether they've been shortlisted or not by the end of the year. Interviews in January and February.   51) I really do appreciate the transparancy on this round.  I hope it spreads to the rest of the field. x2 52) Any updates about this search? 53) Curious if this search will actually lead to hiring somebody or just be a failed search like it has been for multiple years in a row 54) they did hire someone last year (55) I interviewed last year and invitation came on Dec16 (56) @53 they made two hires last year. (57) [in dept] we initially offered two PIs the position, they both declined, then one postdoc who accepted. (58) Any invitations go out yet? (59) no news here (12/15) x4.

(1) Wow, both searches failed at UBC last yr? x3 (2) What's the salary range? 3) any insights into why the search failed last year?  4) Is it true they heavily favor Canadian applicants? 5) No @4, it's not true. They're ""supposed to"", but it's not enforced in any practical sense. Apply if you want the job! 6) SC member here. We encourage applicants to read through the educational leadership criteria linked in the ad, and encourage applicants of all nationalities to apply. 7) Hi SC member. What's the salary range? 8) expected starting 12-mo salary is $105,000 8) why doesn'tt the 12-mo salary align with research-oriented assistant professors in the department? (9) @8, The position doesn't require a Ph.D., so the qualifications and training time are significantly less than the research-oriented assistant professors. 10) Strange answer @9 since your recent hires for AP Teaching have PhDs and you will likely offer the job to someone with a PhD. 11) SC member here again - @9 that isn't the logic here. Pay scales are very similar and Assistant Professor salaries in the department tend to rise quickly for members of both teaching and research streams. More on UBC faculty salaries can be found on the faculty association website: https://www.facultyassociation.ubc.ca/worklife/salaries/ (9 again) @SC member, to clarify, I was just noting that the salary might and should be lower for some candidates given the requirements for the job. Candidates without a PhD should have a lower starting salary than those with, just given the difference in training time. The high end is absolutely competitive with research stream professors, and this is great. No complaints here! 12) Is that $105,000 CAD or USD? If CAD, then the salary is roughly $76,000 USD, which is a much more difficult wage for Vancouver living. (13) Since it's Canada it's CAD. 105K is fine for Vancouver, rent is about 2-3K / month for an apt. 14) Yes, new UBC faculty here, you can definitely live on the salary comfortably, even with a family, if you are happy with urban apartment living (it is my preference but not for everyone). And salaries go up very quickly in your first few years. 15) Hopefully SC is aware that skilled data scientists make much much more than 105k in Canada (16) Yes but we are asking people to teach , therefore they're not as valued by society (although arguably producing more value for it) 17) 105000 after tax gives 6500/month, so unless you're ""fine"" with spending close to half of salary on rent, or have a partner who makes similar, you definitely wont be ""living comfortably"" on that salary especially not with a family 18) I do live very comfortably, as do my peers, but I recognize that everybody has different standards of living. A very personal consideration when moving to cities with high housing costs. For me, the pros of living and working here overwhemlingly outweigh the cons. Anyway, this conversation is getting beyond the scope of this particular job, but happy to answer any questions about this position!! 19) This salary is manageable for the location. Any city in North American with a high cost of living would be very challenging for a family on a single salary. This shouldn't be a surprise. 20) @18 how is discussing the salary for this job 'beyond the scope of this particular job'? The issue isn't whether the salary is ""manageable"" for Vancouver -- lots of salaries are -- its if you're paying enough to get someone that can teach data science effectively 21) who should we address/email questions on the application to? I have a question about the CV formatting since it says ""Curriculum vitae, including a summary of teaching experience and evidence of effectiveness."" Normally I would include those in my 2-pg teaching statement, but you want them as an additional page(?) in the CV? thanks 22) I think we've already handled this inquiry via e-mail but find me at kaitlyn.gaynor@ubc.ca","","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thanks! 2) Please stop asking for letters of recommendation at the application stage. It's such a waste of time for anyone that isn't among the 10-15 people chosen for initial interviews.

And argh, I thought they only wanted contact info so now I guess my letter writers have one more unexpected thing on their plates this week. 4) The need for refs by the date was NOT clear in the ad or the application so mine have still not all been submitted.

So frustrating. 5) For any SC members, just FYI I did not apply explicitly because there was a requirement for letters upfront 4)  Yep #5 makes a good point and it's even worse that the wording was so ambiguous we couldn't even tell what was required. 6) Been a few weeks with this one - anyone heard anything? 7) nothing here as of 11/9, 11/15 x3 8) Nothing for me as of 11/27 x5 9) Nothing as of 12/4 x 5 10) per some website snooping it looks like they are interviewing candidates on campus this week 11) https://www.oberlin.edu/events/biology_seminar_migration_and_sharing_in_microbial_communities https://www.oberlin.edu/events/biology_seminar_measuring_and_manipulating_the_mosquito_microbiota https://www.oberlin.edu/events/biology_seminar_big_mammals_bigger_pictures Yup, looks like they're interviewing 3. 12) Thanks #11 I guess I'll cross that one off, sigh.

Winter temperatures in the -20s or -30s F are not at all uncommon. Summers are very buggy as well. But it's a beautiful area with lots of outdoor recreation opportunities in both summer and winter. The nice thing about the cold is that the snow actually sticks around and is beautiful, instead of immediately turning to brown slop. Also, the winters aren't as gray as they are on, say, the East Coast. Once you get past mid-January, it tends to be pretty sunny. 5) I lived in northern MN for a couple years and I miss it. It is one of the most gorgeous places in the country, Itasca being one of my favorites. The people are amazing. I seriously miss it and would highly suggest giving it a try for anyone on the fence. 6) I wonder if the pay range will be low. The position seems classified for a BS level. 4) Yeah, they're willing to take someone with a BS but prefer MS or PhD. Kind of a weird qualifications spread, so hard to say what the pay is. Though cost of living would be very low there. 7) I thought it was interesting there was a statement about temp housing for this position and did look up houses for sale/rent. From what I can see online are fairly few and far between, though I'm not from around there so any insight could help others... based on the prices of the homes though that may indicate a lower pay range due to lower COL 8) Yes, few houses are available up there.

If you are a candidate working in an area of population genetics and/or pop. genomics, we will review your application equally against all others. 6) Just a note, after submitting the application, I had to go back into my account and separately add my birthday for some reason. The system said my application would not be reviewed without doing that step. Only after doing that did I get a confirmation email.7) any tips on getting your reprints to be < 5Mb? 8) @7, I usually run them through a free pdf compressor software online. It compresses the quality of the graphics (sad), but gets the job done. 9) I got the same birthday prompt right after submitting the app. FYI be VERY careful with the lengthy disclosure questions...I mistakenly answered one ""yes"" that prompted an HR response about all sorts of certifying documents, but there's no way to edit apps, so I withdrew mine, and then realized that there's no option to re-submit after withdrawing (so I ended up making a new account with my personal email address). Just a head's up about this. 10) To the SC member- have Zoom invites or letters been requested yet? x2 11) Received an email 11/29 I have not moved to the next round.

Hoping to get a great colleague to join what, in my biased opinion, is an excellent department to work in. Will try to check in periodically to address questions. 2) Thank you, SC member! 3) What does this mean ""Application Materials will be reviewed by department faculty at the finalist stage of interviews."" ? 4) @3 It means that app materials (except letters) for finalists who interview on campus are shared with all dept faculty. Other apps remain internal to search comm. 5) phylogenetics is pretty broad, any insight as to what flavor of phylogenetics this position is excpected to fill? 6) Who is the search chair for this position? The contact given on the ad is in HR, what if we have questions about the scientific scope of the position, who can we contact? 7) From #1: @5 yes, definitely a broad area and the (non-exhaustive) list of example topics in the ad reflects the fact that we don't have a specific ""flavor"" in mind. Really are open to anyone with strong depth of experience in phylogenetic methods. Also, important that at least part of their research program addresses biological questions (at any level: molecular, cellular, organismal, etc). Someone with a purely computer science and algorithmic focus would probably not be a good fit. @6 Not 100% sure if HR wants us publicly disclosing SC members. Feel free to reach out the contact in the ad. He'll put you in touch with SC for non-HR questions. 8) @7, thank you! Will do! 9) Question for the SC member - would a research program that uses but doesn't develop phylogenetic methods be competitive? 10) @9 Yes, we are looking for a substantial depth of expertise in phylogenetic approaches, but that doesn't mean candidates necessarily have to be developing those methods. 11) thanks CSU for listing the salary range! 84-90K. 12) In case anyone's wondering, that salary range is for 9-month appt. Obviously higher with summer salary. 13) I submitted my application materials but would like to update them. I wasn't able to do that in the system. Is it still possible to do so? 14) @13 From SC member: I suspect so but not entirely sure how the system works. Get in touch with the search contact listed in the job posting. He would be the best admin contact. 15) It says 45% research, 45% teaching - how is teaching effort allocated? Is 40% 2-2, for instance (meaning 10% for a typical 3-credit course)? 16) @15 A 45% teaching appt in our dept is typically a total of 1.5 courses per year. 17) Any idea when should we expect to hear back? 18) rejection email today 10/31.

There are DOZENS of us. DOZENS! 28) Still no word either positive or negative as of the evening of 11/03/23.

I once got a rejection letter actually signed in pen -- I was strangely happy with that. 33) or... they are reserve. 34) @31 from SC: Unfortunately, everyone should know their standing at this point and all interviewees have confirmed.

Teaching load is 1 small graduate class per year in your area. Please apply! 7) I applied last year and only received a rejection letter. Would it be reasonable for me to apply again? I am asking this because I was told not to by the search committee in the following year after I was interviewed for a similar position at the same institution in UK (unless I had a Science or Nature paper in between). 8) This gets discussed a lot here, but it probably can't hurt, especially given that the app only asks for a cv, cover letter, and research statement. I applied last year and am doing so again. (9) @7 did the SC explicitly state those journals as the criterion to be hired? 10) @9 I now do not remember exactly, but I do remember that the committee member emailed me back and said a ""significant achievement"" since the last interview (only 1 year in between) and might have mentioned Nature. 11) @7 How about Nature communications? Does that count?  12) How about ""Nature and Science""? http://www.sciencepub.net/nature/ 13) Nature Scientific Reports also counts 14) Letters and additional documents were requested on 11/16 x2 15) Apparently only ""Nature"" counts 16) Should you submit the additional documents if you weren't longlisted? I'm really crushed but I don't feel like I was able to submit my entire faculty package x2 17) I don't think you can submit the additonal documents without getting the link from them. You will feel nothing after failing 100 times like me ;) 18) I didn't receive a longlisted email and yet the system allows me to submit the extra documents and request reference letters. x2 (19) It says ""Longlisted candidates have received an email from OIST. Please follow the instructions in the email."" If you didn't get one, I'm sure you didn't make long list. I didn't get one, and I am sure I didn't make long list. 20) @19 Are you still able to upload file on system? 20) Anyone know if they plan to hire again next year, or does this search mark the end of their expansion push (missed the app. deadline)? 21) I was also not longlisted (received no email about it) and feel crushed (I am Japanese) even after failing about 50 times in the last 1.5 years. I would like to know what differentiated applicants who were longlisted vs not listed. It would help me calibrate my competency in the job market. Was it Open Rank? I heard that Japanese universities do not hire people > 40 years old for assistant prof positions. Is this true? I did not write my birthday on the application, so I suppose this rumor does not apply to OIST? Usually Japanese CV forms have a blank for a birthday.  22) I was also not longlisted and I am also Japanese. I have been longlisted at other jobs on this board that >2x as many people here say that they've applied to. I would appreciate the feedback.  23) @21 and @22 I was also not long listed. To give you a sense on who else wasn't long listed, I am a US researcher (35yo) with 15 publications (8 first author), 160 citations, articles in Ecology Letters/Functional Ecology/Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, and 1.6M in extramural funding (US NSF and USDA mostly). I am straight to PhD and started publishing my work in 2019. Given comments I see above, I'm assuming they wanted more experienced researchers but just like you IDK. Maybe you have many X the number of papers I do and still did not move forward. (24) I've got >1k cites, >12 f/o papers (>20 total), no long list, white male.                                                                           32/yo. 25) I am #22. I got a PhD in 2015, older than usual, Japanese female, non-Japanese BS, MS, and PhD, 20 pubs (11 first), 2000+ citations but 1200 come from minor contribution on review papers, papers in AmNat, J Anim Ecology, Royal Society B. 26) I made the long list. 34/yo male, PhD in 2021 + 2 year postdoc, instructor of record of grad-level course, 750 citations, 30 papers (19 first author), Curr Bio, Proc B, Mol Biol Evol, Nat Ecol Evol. 27) I'm not long-listed either, 36 yo male Japanese, 41 pubs (20+ as the first, three of which are PNAS, others in Proceedings B, J Applied Ecol etc.), have a US NSF grant. 28) this is a rank-open hire that can draw from any field, so it shouldn't be that surprising how competitive it is. 29) Heard there were around 300 EEB applicants 30) Invited to a campus interview","11","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(I am a professor there. Our research programs are primarily with undergrads) 3) 2, I went here as an undergraduate and things have changed a bit in the decade +  since I was there, so take my response with several grains of salt. When I was a student there, no faculty did much research. However, the department is much younger now and I think they have started prioritizing undergraduate research opportunities more than they used to. I know faculty there occasionally served on undergraduate honors thesis comittees, but I wouldn't expect a lot of opportunities to advise graduate students. It's also worth noting that the campus is approximately an hour drive from Emory's main campus in Atlanta and serves only first and second year students. After the second year, they continue their undergraduate education on the Atlanta campus. 4) Interviewed here a while back and had a positive experience. Ended up not accepting a multi-year teaching instructor renewable position, but found the SC collegial. Also, from what I learned then, #3 is on track - there isn't much collaboration with Emory's main campus. Only first and second years on campus here.  On the upside, cost of living is more reasonable in theis are (Emory area is very expensive) and your commute would be less stressful. 5) Any updates on this as of 11.29?  6) I had a Zoom interview but haven't heard anything for several weeks...7) @ 6 thanks.

This is an honest question. I'm not trying to complain. 6) I'd say it may be tight on that salary, but possibly doable. A car is an absolute necessity though. (7) @3 the college sponsors visas for foreign nationals. 8) @5 As someone who grew up in the area and still has family/friends there, I'd say the salary is grossly insufficient.

SC member: This search is broad, but we are particulary interested in people doing research in phylogenomics, evolutionary genomics, and/or disease ecology. Ideal candidates could teach genomics / computational bio and biostats courses. This application does NOT require letters of reference up front, just contact information. 2) It says no letters required upfront, but when you are applying it says 3 are required as part of the application. Perhaps a mistake from their HR? @2) Thanks for highlighting this...it should be fixed now 3) Can somebody (SC) speak to this being a Jesuit institution ""still influenced by Jesuit teachings"", and to what extent that does or does not impact faculty studying evolution, etc.? 4) SC member here: Fordham is no longer officially run by the Jesuits, so they say they are in the ""Jesuit tradition"". There are classes and programs in Jesuit philosophy / theology available for undergraduates, and a fellowship available for women in the sciences at Catholic colleges (Clare Booth Luce; many of our PhD students have this fellowship and don't teach for a few years. You don't have to be Catholic to get it). There are some Jesuit brothers living on campus, and a few still teaching. But day to day Fordham's Jesuit affiliation has zero impact on faculty outside of theology or other narrow programs (and Jesuits do not deny evolution FWIW). The mission statement of the university says something about the university being for people of all faiths and no faith. The new president of Fordham is the first non-Jesuit to hold that post (and the first woman). 5)Just want to chim in that I did my undergraduate degree in biochemistry at a different Jesuit institution and my intro biology professor was a Jesuit- I literally learned evolution from a priest. Jesuit education is about educating the whole person and definitely not anti-science. 4) SC member again: in response to a request: the teaching load in this department is 2.5 courses / year (1 / 1.5). Half of a lecture course or one lab section counts as 0.5 courses. A lecture course that meets 2x / week for 1.25 hours each session typically counts as 1 course towards the load. We have both undergraduate and graduate courses. 7) Did they add more questions from HR recently? I've submitted my application but now it is saying it is incomplete as two required questions were not answered, but I don't know how that's possible when you can't submit it without answering them all? There is no option to edit, can the SC member ask HR to enable editing? 8) Is anyone else unable to access the department website? It may be because I am in Europe, but even if I use a VPN i'm getting a 403 Forbidden error. 9) No problem here 8) It's working for me today. *shrug*  9) Zoom invite 11/10 x5 (10) Congrats / RIP me! x2 11) campus invite email on 12/19. x3","12","Match, exact","Fordham University","NY",191241,"Bronx","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Not Classified","Mid East DE DC MD NJ NY PA","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,2544,2669,112,401,0,5726,5472,14984,5,576,9,11,8,84,28,84,473,2597,1706,838,0,0,16972,19139,16364,14042.666667,9399,6965,8838,261,49,251,3995,2970,2071,15,240,10,NA,NA,23,52,NA,1291,0.225463,50,79,19,0.38,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,18,10,4842,1498,693,620,610,1230,27,25,25.632588,47936,25180,0.525284,3

Search failed last year. (2) Any insight into why it failed or what they might be looking for; i.e., what we might emphasize--if we have it--in our apps? (3) why do searches fail when so many people are desperate for jobs? (4) the search last year failed because the person that was offered the job accepted another position  5) Person, Singular?  Only one person worth employing?  This institution usually gets lots of applicants. 6) @5 its more common than you think. They probably wanted that person specifically and didn't even look at other apps 7) @3 you're essentially hiring a colleague for life. sometimes a search doesn't bring in anyone that the faculty feels is the right fit. depending on the nature of the funding for the position, they'll often cut bait and wait until the following year or even later in the hope of generating a different applicant pool.  (8) my understanding is that it failed because of dysfunctional department politics. this department is notorious for that (see discussion in General Discussion and in Venting this year and last). What I heard is some search committee members didn't even schedule meetings with non-offered candidates. This department also has a history of interviewing nationals from the developing world to fill out diversity quotas but categorically will not offer to them. Very likely most of the interviewed candidates weren't given serious consideration.  9) Search members not meeting candidates and not seeing talks would be an HR violation at my school that could pull the search completely.  Seems rude to candidates as well.  Past searches have not handled COIs well.  It makes me think this school does not value fair hiring practices if they let those practices continue.  It's a shame because it is such a great school. (10) @7 -- when you get well-over triple-digit apps, if you can't find a ""colleague for life"" it is perhaps because the faculty is not willing to expand their view of their ideal colleague. x2 (11) maybe this is a department that needs to clear house after a few big name people retire. x3 (12) This is one salty, bitter job board; I thought gossip and venting were reserved for other pages? x6  13) @12, seems like a lot of useful information to me. (14) useful but take it with many grains of salt x2 [personal attack deleted, while I ponder how to clean up the rest of this borderline appropriate discussion -AP] (15) Please don't let this unfounded speculation discourage you from applying. In my experience it's quite an amazing environment for new faculty! x5 16) @15, if you are one of the people who makes it past the interview issues, then I'm sure it is.  That doesn't mean they did right by all candidates on their past searches.  x3 (17) I'm in this dept as postdoc and have no idea why people here are so negative. This place rules, and everyone should apply for this job. x2 (18) previous postdoc with one of the 'bigwigs' - not a great Dept. 19) Good dept or not, good luck living in Vancouver on this salary - unless your partner happens to make the same or preferably much, much more. @19, what is the salary, I don't see it in the ad? (20) expect between 110-145 depending on experience (12 month), is my best guess. (21) The university provides faculty housing (22) @18 why is the dept ""not great""? Are you talking about Zoology? Everyone I know who's either worked or studied there is fantastic and has loved it aside from the usual gripes about vancouver housing. Super collegial, collaborative and interdisciplinary department with a strong sense of community among students and faculty. 23) @18 and @22, the word you're looking for is ""quaint"" 24) seems like people's experiences of UBC depend on whether specific faculty members believe their research qualifies as ""evolutionary biology."" 25) as a pdoc in the dept, my impression is that the search failed last year because they were looking for someone to fill the macroevolution methods void that was recently created, but the department could use some younger faculty and I speculate their search this year so as to avoid another delay in hiring such a person - p.s. the dept is great. (26) Definitely being macro/methods is an advantage, but the person they offered to last year does not fit this mold! (27). Getting ready to submit an app.....aaand letters due by the 1st.... (28) @27 That sucks... what I do is when I see a job, I immediately check to see if letters are needed. If so I start the online app so those letters can be sent right away. You can come back and fill in the rest of the app later. This is not an endorsement of letters upfront. Good luck! (29) Anyone have updates? 30) As of 10/10, nope (but it's only been <10 days since the deadline; I wouldn't expect to hear anything until November, at least) 31) Counting down the days until November so I can ask again x4 (32) Happy November! Still nothing on my end x15 33) Still nothing as of 11/7 x6 (32 again) Just checked - last year the search was posted Oct 17th, letters requested in December, invites in January. Might be a long wait... SC head mentioned interviews early in the new year on Twitter (33) A weird quirk of the search last year (if you look back at the previous job ad) is that interview email requests were directed to >1 candidate's junk boxes - so keep an eye on them too! 34) Email about in-person interview x4 (11/23). 35) Ooof. Happy Thanksgiving, I suppose. Congrats to you, 34. (36) Canadian TG is in October (37) I'm sure plenty of Americans applied to this (34) I am american, and was incredibly surprised to get an invite.

It just takes me to my general interfolio page, but I can't find the details for this job. Did anyone else get into it? 3) @2: ""Application materials may be submitted beginning Aug 21, 2023."" 4) Teaching expectations for this position include Human Anatomy at Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School. 5) Brown University *handshake* every community college - expecting you to teach human anatomy 6) EEB, but also teach gross anatomy to medical students? Kind of a strange combo 7) not that strange for those who study organismal biology with eco/evo bent. There are lots of us (8) Marginal EcoEvo job? Can't imagine applying for this (9) #6 here again, I am an organismal biologist who is solidly EEB, and I have to say this is odd from my perspective. Unless someone does biomech`anics, or happened to have taught anatomy as a grad student, I'm honestly not sure of the overlap, but whatever! (10) biomechanics, functional morphology, evolutionary morphology, comparative morphology, ecomorphology, eco-evo-devo, paleontology, just to name a few... (7 again) let's not gatekeep too much based on our own biases of how ""small"" our fields should be. I strongly consider myself an evolutionary biologist with eco tilt yet there are plenty of jobs listed I don't qualify for. This is one I do. Why is teaching human biology automatically outside of evolution? Plenty of extremely well-known evo biologists who focus on form/morphology/anatomy have taught human anat. This is not a marginal ecoevo job and it absolutely makes sense to be on this sheet. If GIS can be on here (which I agree with) organismal biology can be, too. x2 (11) Don't ya'll have better things to do with your time than police whether job postings are ecoevo or not? (12) @11 Nah, we're all unemployed! That's why we hang around here so much! ;p haha x3. (13) From within the department: they are legitimately very open to people with 0 existing anatomy experience, which is why the ad is phrased the way it is (14) In addition to being a big +1 to being an eco/evo person for whom this job is extremely relevant, I also want to highlight that affiliation with anatomy courses is a terrific way to support your students and postdocs! anatomy classes always need TAs, postdocs can be supported through teaching anatomy, and there is plenty of $$ in med schools for those roles. Plus, the vertebrate eeb/organismal biology community has a long history of getting hired as anatomy faculty. (15) @14 that'd be a totally valid point if Brown Med weren't pushing to transition to a prosection-based model. Anatomy jobs are a gamble these days. (16) This posting is a bit odd, innit? ""Hey do some organismal biology, but oh you have to teach about humans too."" It is odd in that they're going to set aside millions of dollars to hire a tenure-track professor to teach one class when the new prof likely researches something else. (17) the combination of human anatomy and EEB is a stereotypical and extremely common position listing for vertebrate paleontologists, if you talk to many paleontologists that is in fact their job description for teaching. many paleontologists work at medical schools and their graduate training specifically prepares them for this. not sure why this is a controversial posting x1 (18) It's controversial because some people just lose their minds when a posh job is posted and they're not a fit for it. x3 19) In case some people missed it.

Because it is only open for 10 days and it is not posted anywhere other than the career website of the school. 1) Ugh I was excited about this until I read this 2) People complain about Universities not offering their VAPs tenure-track position, and they complain when they do, but you can't complain about both. If it is an internal hire, good for that VAP I'm sure it is making their dream come true and I'm glad that they won't be stuck in VAP limbo watching their career dwindle. If you are interested, throw your app at it and move on. +2 (3) totally agree. It's actually heartening to see a VAP--who has already given to the school--be recognized as a good colleague with the promise of a long career. No need to butt them out with ""the latest and greatest shiny new thing"" when a great candidate is right there. Normalize steady careers and locations! 4) @2 & 3, I don't think the complaint is about them hiring the VAP, but about lots of other good candidates applying, thinking they have a chance, even interviewing. I have gone on three on campus interviews where an internal candidate was ultimately hired. I spent so much time prepping and traveling for those, and I just wish they had promoted the internal candidate without a national search (yes, this is possible at some places). At least this one seems very obvious and gives a super short turnaround so maybe it won't waste too many people's time. 5) Agree with 4. I'm not annoyed with a VAP being hired for a permanent position--that should be normalized! I'm annoyed that institutions still run a national search for internal promotions of that nature, which takes up other people's time and energy. That also happened to me last season. Doing all of the prep and practice for an on campus interview ate up a lot of my time and it was all for naught. 6) anyone hear anything? 7) Confirmed will be internal hire (8) Can we normalize not wasting people's time with public job postings for internal hires?

Beautiful area though 4) I am a current faculty member at Southern Oregon University (SOU), but I am not affiliated with this search: Indeed, SOU is a small, regional, public university with a high teaching load (~12 contact hours per term) and low research expectations (~1 paper required for tenure). Like many regional universities, SOU has struggled financially (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2023/03/22/president-proposes-steep-job-cuts-save-his-institution), but I (and I think many other faculty members) are optimistic about the future. This position could be a great fit for an environmental scientist who would enjoy teaching during the school year and mentoring students through research during the summer. Here is some more information about SOU and faculty life there: a) Faculty salaries increase 2-3% every year based on explicit salary tables outlined in the collective bargaining agreement; b) Many faculty enjoy comfortable lives in Ashland at the current salaries, but the cost of housing makes buying a home difficult for new faculty. Being a dual-income household helps, of course; c) Many faculty still own homes in Ashland and surrounding cities; d) Ashland, OR is an amazing place to live and do research, especially for environmental scientists and ecologists; and e) The administration is actively growing environmental degree programs and research programs. If you are an environmental scientist who loves teaching and wants to live in a vibrant small town with near-perfect weather, amazing restaurants, abundant public lands, and world-class theater, then you should consider SOU. 5) This isn't an ecology or evolution listing though 6) @5 The ad specifically mentions soil science and ecohydrology. Seems germane to this board. 7) Yeah, it's not much of a leap from soil ecology or biogeochemistry to this stuff. 8) I appreciate the SOU context-- thanks @4!  8) These vacancies can be filled by anyone with an aquatics background.  ECOHYDROLOGY and SOIL ECOLOGY are pretty clearly ECOLOGY! 10) Man, the ecoevo gatekeepers are riled up this cycle... 11) I am advocating for a statement of erring on the side of inclusivity for job postings. This is a board to help people and having more postings is more helpful. Having to scroll past a few lines that don't apply to you doesn't hurt anything. (x7) 12) in support of #11, if you are truly an EVS graduate, you should be able to teach some soils.  If you can't, your degree is really something else.  The USEPA defined an EVS PHD as someone with a multidisiplinary degree drawing from Social, natural, and physical sciences.  The recommended background was courses in env. policy/law, environmental biology, environmental chemistry/geology, and later, env. sociology was added.  this was published many years ago in Science.  However, most programs are poor-man's ecology or chemistry programs with little real interdisciplinary nature.  An EVS person should have an emphasis in one of the four areas.  But, they should have no problem teaching a few freshman courses in any of the other fields. 13) Search committe member here -- deadline extended to 10/27. 14) Any updates? 15) zoom interviews this week 16) 12/5 - anyone gotten an offer?","1","Match, exact","Southern Oregon University","OR",210146,"Ashland","Master's Colleges & Universities: Larger Programs","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Education-dominant, with Arts & Sciences","Four-year, medium full-time, inclusive, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, medium, primarily residential","Not Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Suburb Midsize","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","Yes","No","No",0,883,254,0,0,0,1137,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,59,195,504,379,0,0,6093,7788,5140,3725.333333,4518,622,2717,745,94,962,207,415,529,45,316,60,NA,NA,18,52,NA,232,0.204046,29,11,8,0.275862,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,8,0,950,465,223,490,490,980,18,19,18.675872,2320,2098,0.90431,1

Evolutionary biologists who use molecular and cellular tools are encouraged to apply. Great place to work in a growing department with new building, new greenhouse, and more hires anticipated.  Starting salary range $90-98.5K.  2) sounds great - any chance of associate-level hiring (unlikely I'm sure, but thought I'd ask). 3). The position has only been approved at the assistant level, but we would be interested in advanced assistants with credit towards tenure.  Unlikely that associate-level hire would be approved, but very manageable tenure expectations 4) What's teaching load like here?  5) I believe the teaching load is 13.5 credits a year.  One example of how this roughly works is to teach ~2 sections of a (often the same) course one semester (6 credits; e.g., 2 sections of intro bio) and an upper division lab that you would prep the second semester (e.g., lecture + lab for the same course; ~7 credits).   Every few years you may need to take on an extra section of a pre-prepped lab to make up that extra half credit. 6) Curious, given there are already 4-5 VAP in this department, what chances do external candidates realistically have? 7) Excellent chances for outside candidates.  While occasionally, visitors have been hired for open tenure lines, it is the exception and not the rule.  8) Did anyone hear anything here?

Yuck. What a waste of everyone's time. x2 (2) agree with 1 and not applying if letters required up front. X8 3) A huge ""BOOOOOO!"" to this SC. (4) legit not trolling here, but is asking for letters up front really that big of a deal? Don't most people's references have stock letters more or less put together at this point in their careers? Is this really a deal breaker? Isn't something like a 4 page tailored research statement more demanding? 6) Yes, no, yes, some of us care about other people's time besides our own (4) @6, no need to get snippy. I was just curious why this point is a deal breaker for some when other parts of the research package take much more time and effort to prepare (like a 4 vs 2 page research proposal) but aren't a deal breaker. Many people's references have letters ready from previous apps, and it doesn't take much time to tweak on their end. I actually do care about other people's time as well. Thanks for your mature and respectful response though. (7) if you fit the job description, apply. Your letter writers will not mind, trust me (from a letter writer). Best advice is to apply to as many jobs as you can, if you want a succesful job season. Not applying because of letters unneccesarily reduces your chances of an interview in a given year. x4. (8) I suggest not to post an irrelevant argument that does not help people in looking for a summarized description of useful items from the position. (9) fun fact for the ""upfront letters are gross"" crowd: your writers may get more advanced notice and prefer it that way! I usually know I'm applying 4-6 weeks ahead of time and give them notice, but when I've been invited for interviews they're usually given ~2 weeks to get their letters in. x2 (9) the entitlement and self-importance of the position of the folks who claim they don't apply for a job with letters up front is galling.

(4) I suspect that, like most searches, they have a broad vision and probably some specific thing they're looking for that only will become apparent after everyone's applied! Just shoot your shot if you have materials. 5) Faculty member in department here - this is meant to be a broad search for people who integrate among subdisciplines in biology. We are looking for someone with strong quantitative skills. 6) @5 is there ever a faculty search where they're looking for someone with mediocre quantitative skills? 7) @4 second faculty member here. There isn't anything specific behind the scenes, we're open to a wide range of disciplines as we hope this is the first of several hires.

Are non-citizens who can get a visa welcome to apply? 12) yes international applicants welcome and encouraged. 13) Once a non-American citizen accepts a job at a US university, the Uni will sponsor them for a visa, and they will be a lawful authorized worker. Go ahead and apply! 14) what 13 said is typically quite true, but note that there is no guarantee a school will want to sponsor a visa, especially smaller schools.

I ended up taking a position elsewhere that was a better fit- but the folks were super nice the town(s) adorable (great food, cool farmers market), and the grad students were top tier. For folks who fit the very broad posting, don't pass this one up. I really enjoyed my time interacting with the community here. 16) search chair is Wes Dowd 17) Does this position only asks for a CV first? I see no option in the system to upload the other documents. 18) The ad says ""External candidates, please upload all documents in the “Resume/CV” section of your application."" 19) a second position was just added to this posting, with a deadline of October 15 20) Thanks WSU for listing salary range! 85-90k for assist, 90-95k for assoc 21) pay attention to the word ""potential"" for the second position.

I read that the deadline was 11:59 on September 20, but the link to both jobs is dead? Is this an error or did it close on the 19th? 23) @22 it looks closed for me too. 24) @22,23 Same here. I've emailed the SC chair about the issue. 25) I submitted my application last night but received no confirmation email that it submitted OK, so I went to double check the ad this morning to email SC but the job also seems to have disappeared. Did others who applied get confirmation emails of submission? 26) I never received a confirmation email, but the application dashboard says ""Application Received"" 27) Search chair here: There was a HR issue with the application site but the posting is now available again so please try to apply before tonight's deadline. Apologies for the confusion. Also, I do not believe that Workday issues a confirmation email when applications are submitted. Thanks. 28) Thank you SC-I came here to ask about workday confirmation! 29) ""The max number of files that can be uploaded is '5'"". They asked us for 7 documents. Not a big deal, but wanted others to know. 29) Yeah, anyone struggling with upload? My file is WAY over size limits... 30) Yeah 5MB for that number of files is really hard. I wasn't able to compress one of my reprints enough - couldn't get it under 9MB for that one file! So I included a link to it in my cover letter and explained the file size issue. Hopefully that's okay! 31) I ended up submitting multiple files cause of the limit. One of my reprints alone was nearly at the limit, even compressed. 32) Received a confirmation email from workday this morning (applied yesterday). x3 33) Very strange-I didn't receive any confirmation from workday (site for internal candidates)-I wonder why the discrepency? 34) I am so used to workday pooping out that my advice is to not sweat it. 35) @34 lol yes 36) Any word yet? 37) Nope.

(48) @SC, what does it mean that second round of review has not begun? Also, seems strange to do zoom interviews but not letter requests? 49) not SC, but can say that zoom invites also included a request for letters. 50) I assume ""second round of review"" refers to the second hire they're likely making for the position, which had a review date of 10/15, but it's not clear how they'll review applicants for the 2nd position. 51) Can people who got invites this round share their career stage? 52) @ 45, same research topic as @47 for me.

(email to EEB and do the official September 16 deadline). (2) The LSA Collegiate Fellows Program was designed to enhance diversity amongst postdocs and ECRs transitioning into faculty positions - maybe fair to assume the same is true for any associate level hires.

(16) Could someone please explain what is a writing sample? -> Published works (2-3 works; 35 pages maximum per writing sample). This is the first time I see this document. (17) I believe that is copies of your best publications. (18) !!Elligibility criteria  - PhD earned between 2019 and 2024!! 19) @18 this is true but only for the Collegiate Fellowship, not for the Senior Collegiate Fellowship. 20) Gosh, it is the second time I see a position at UM and it is always such a mess re: submission of application material, letters etc. It is always so confusing. I'd suggest UM to review these and make it easier for everyone. Personally, this confusion and having to submitt the letters in advance are the reason I am not applying. 21) The application link is not working for me. 22) The entire network was down for about 3 days at UMich. The link should be working now. And this search is not a mess. it is a program run through the college. You submit your materials to EEB for feedback to improve your application. Then you submit to the college at the later deadline. Reach out to the department if you have questions or are confused. 23) @14 would you mind elaborating, still thank you if not.  24) Can we still apply if we missed EEB's Sept. 16th deadline? x2 25) @24 yes! I asked them a while ago about this. Get your materials to the department asap though. The Sept deadline was ""soft"" so they could help improve materials from suitable candidates. 26) @25 Does this mean they will tell applicants whether they are ""suitable"" before the October deadline? x6 27) @14 what was so bad about it? just curious about what to be aware of. 28) Has anyone heard anything? x6 29) Virtual interviews happening this week. 25) @26, I suppose so. I don't really know for sure. It's just what I was told when I inquired. I didn't end up applying though. 30) @29 This week is over.. is there a point in applying on 10/16 if we weren't contacted? 31) @30 I am not on the committee, but I would suspect not because that application (due in Oct) would not go through EEB, it would go to another entity who decides on who is hired. So, if one is not approved or considered by the department first, I don't think there would be much of a chance in that second hiring round. 32) This feels pretty awkward. Will they reply to our application to tell us not to apply? Wondering if I should tell my letter writers not to bother. x10 33) Radio silence here too. Well, at this point, I won't even bother applying, especially since reference letters are due by the 16th. 34) Rejection letter--didn't get a Zoom invite x12 35) Rejection letter - after zoom interview. x3 (35) Was the interview with EEB or with the DEI Fellow program? (36) @35 with EEB (37) Hm, didn't realize that was even a formal interview with EEB. Any idea what they were looking for? @35 on campus interview happening this and next week with the EEB community. (38) @36, heard through the grapevine that the preferred candidate is an assoc prof from another R1 the department has wanted to poach for a long time, so there's little you could do with this 39) lmao 40) Oh FFS x2 41) did anyone else list other departments as options? (42) If what 38 says is true, I cannot think of any greater indictment of 'DEI' culture in our field... using this to poach someone who is already succesful is the most cynical thing I've ever heard. x2 43) Why do they waste our time? I spent a lot of effort on this particular application 43) @38, what you heard through the grapevine is not true. There has never been a preferred candidate. 44) @38 Agreed, not on the search committee but am familiar with the search. That doesn't make sense. 45) @44 - unclear who you agree with? You agree there is a preferred candidate or not? 46) @41 I did (stats) and no word yet 47) any word? x2 48) still nothing here (49) email about campus invite for biophysics","19","Match, by alias","University of Michigan-Ann Arbor","MI",170976,"Ann Arbor","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Great Lakes IL IN MI OH WI","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Midsize","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,8715,4691,876,750,0,15032,1572931,100931,2042,4273,79,92,628,76,788,75,2648,2793,5845,2870,0,0,48090,49530,47907,45691.666667,31329,16578,29813,1376,38,102,14733,1845,6835,44,1257,48,NA,NA,24,14,NA,2565,0.170636,76,216,59,0.776316,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,22,23,12242,4393,3277,660,680,1340,31,28,29.281747,65021,16974,0.261054,3

Fantastic research support for a school of this size. 4) @3 Couldn't agree more. 5) Did any of you get a confirmation of submission? While I appreciated not having to fill out the same five pages that everybody else uses, the form here seemed perhaps a little too bare-bones... 6) @5, I got an email confirmation about 90 minutes after I submitted. My letters were already submitted.

I have ties to the area, have worked with a wide range of invertebrate groups, have been instructor of record for 4 courses, and have a friend who’s a faculty member in another STEM department there who reviewed my materials, helped me tailor them, and said I looked really competitive. Ah well. Goes to show you can never let yourself assume anything. 11) @7, I'm really sorry to hear that (I'm in the same boat as an unsuccessful applicant). Did you do a zoom interview? You might be able to ask for feedback from the search chair 12) @7 Similar here - family in the area, instructor of record for multiple courses, history of working on inverts, lots of undergrad supervision. Hard to know sometimes. I'm really starting to feel like the more I tailor my application, the less likely I am to interview! And just to be clear, I'm sure all the applicants who landed interviews are amazing and I wish you guys well! 7) @11, thanks. And no, not even a zoom invite. And dang, you were probably better positioned than me, at least on ""the metrics"". I don't have a whole lot of mentoring experience myself (trying to change that in my current position despite barriers). And yeah @12, so far the one zoom invite I've gotten this cycle (Le Moyne, unfortunately no in-person invite followed) was for an application I tailored much less than others and even had an embarrassing typo in the cover letter (not the name of another institution, mind you, but pretty bad for someone who prides myself on proofreading skill, lol). 9 again) I'm in the same boat, @7 and @12: been teaching faculty for 6 years, have experience at a peer SLAC, some undergrad mentoring, lived in Michigan for years, study insects, but never even got a nibble! That made for a downer week. 13) Man, at least I’m not alone! I also have a lot of teaching and mentoring experience with both terrestrial and aquatic inverts, and yeah, nothing. It’s rough. Either the pool was absolutely star-studded or they were looking for something specific, like a pollinator ecologist to replace the retiring prof.

Perhaps you're right about an extension. I also just hate this strategy - it just rewards folks who had it easy, not necessarily people who are inherently more talented or productive (for the most part).

I think this is a great position for someone who is entirely focused on research and has no interest in teaching or outreach. You can build your own research program, but institutional support is more limited than what you would generally find at a traditional academic institution. There is a lot of pressure to bring in large federal grants, but if you feel confident in your ability to do so, it can be an excellent opportunity for the correct person. 4). I'm a scientist at Cary. Salary is competetive with top notch institutions. It is a hard money position with a community goal of recovering a portion of salary. Feel free to reach out to the search committee with any questions. Many many opportunities for outreach and teaching if interested. Communitity is caring and egaged. 5) I was also a field tech at Cary and I disagree with the statement that this is a position for someone who ""has no interest in outreach or teaching"". Not being a University does mean there is less teaching, but there are still plenty of opportunities to teach if the scientist is interested. Also, the amount of outreach Cary scientists do is often more than a tradition academic position due to the time release of not having consistent teaching requirements. 6) @4 I am curious about the faciltites at the institute, is there any opportunity to chat with someone before hand? I could not find information about labs and othr facilties on the webpage. 4) @6. The search committee is listed on the ad and enthusiastic to speak to folks. reach out to ask about facilities and what you would need to do great science! 5? 7) can anyone speak to the housing market there? It looks like there aren't many houses under $400k based on a quick search 8) Given what (7) had discussed, anyone know if a remote position would be considered? 9) Theres places well below that price 25 min away in Poughkeepsie. 10) @8 This is one of the premier field research oriented institutes in the States. How would one run a program virtually? AP) Review date corrected. 11) @10 Nothing in the ad suggests they are only considering field researchers. It is absolutely possible to be an ecological scientist without conducting field work. I have the same question as @8 regarding the openess to remote work. 12) The way the salary is written in the ad as an ""annualized basis"" is not clear. Could be so many ways to interpret that 13) I interpret annualized basis as per year 14) In HR lingo ""annualized basis"" is total compensation provided to an employee in a year. So I agree it is not necessarily just salary they are including. Do they pull typical academic no summer salary shenanigans here? 15) It is a 12 month salary. This is a non-profit, if you are interested in seeing some of the staff's salaries, tax records are publically available. 16) is it too late to send in now? 17) If you still can-then I would 18) That's a heck of a lot of applicants!! 19) It's for more than one position though, so apps per position maybe are a regular ratio (whatever that is). 18) any updates? 20) doubt they have even starting sorting through the applications yet. 21) Chill out folks. All these positions with people asking for updates 1 or 2 weeks after closing is crazy x3 22) Yeah, unless the ad promises a tight schedule (e.g., ""we will conduct Zoom interviews in mid-October"" for a 10/1 deadline), it's silly to be wondering about updates not even 2 weeks in 23) any updates? 24) No as of 10/18. I think it is still early. 26) This is one of the most popular jobs on here so far (and for multiple openings) so they could have a few hundred applications to go through 27) Still haven't heard anything as of Oct 24.

Oh happy day! 5) I've been adding one word a day since the runway opened. Almost at the perfect application now although not sure I'm going to make it by the early deadline! 6) LOL this is the humor I need to get through the application cycle x2  [lengthy discussion of possible ""internal hire"" removed, since one particular person was singled out. as former 12) wrote: ""Considering they announced a year ago, it seems extremely cynical (even for us) to think it's just a ploy to hire their VAP."" -AP] 13) I have inside info on the posting and it really isn't to hire their current  VAP although they may want to in a separate hire (I don't know that for sure, though, if you're reading, current VAP). they really just wanted to do something unique with this timeline. 14) Who is the search chair for this position? 15) If I submit an application by Sept 1 midnight, does that fall within the deadline? x2 12) So if 18 people took the time and effort to scroll down this specific board to note that they'd applied, what's the estimate of how many total applicants this job got? 200? 300? More? 13) In previous years the figure people bounced around was 5-10x as many applicants as noted here. I know of one (very popular) search where I can confirm it was ~8x as many applications as recorded here. 16) This write up is from 2019, but the author found that the multiplicative factor was 10x the number of people listed on the EcoEvo jobs board: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2019/03/04/heres-some-data-on-how-many-people-apply-for-n-american-tt-faculty-positions-in-ecology-and-allied-fields/ 12) Interesting! I suppose this one might be even higher, considering it's not strictly an ecoevo-only position. 13) Letters requested x4 14)  Would all the letter requests necessarily go out at once? 15) RIP 16) Would be interested to know what sorts of people/qualifications they decided to move forward with, if they are equally represented across biology (any hidden preferences), etc.... 12) I dunno if they'd have a hidden preference for a specific field, though their department is big enough that some candidates would probably overlap a lot with existing faculty members, so they might have a preference for whatever the gaps are. 17) letters requested to candidate or to writers? 12) I think to candidates. I don't recall inputting reference contact info with the initial application. 18) @17 candidates were asked to go in to the system and provide contact info for writers and letter writers were then contacted and asked for letters 19) Any updates? x3 20) still nothing... 10/16 x2 21) Any updates? 22) Who's gonna bite the bullet and reach out to the the search committee? 23) looks like their job candidate seminars are scheduled to start today https://www.carleton.edu/biology/events/seminars/ 24) 8 candidates? That's crazy 25) It looks like 4, with a research seminar one day and teaching seminar the next day 26) Ah yes, you are correct. Well I guess I can stop stalking this job posting now. 25) One advantage of not even being asked for letters is I got to stop caring weeks ago. 27) Would be very curious to know how many total applicants they got, though it would probably be a pretty depressing number. 28) I'd also be interested to hear what the finalists' research areas are/were. Such a broad search! x3 29) anyone from SC here? Can you comment on whether on campus interviews are over? 12) According to their seminar schedule, their last interview teaching seminar is happening today. 13) crazy that no one on this sheet was invited for even a zoom inerview 12) No one active on the sheet at least, but yeah. Maybe they were leaning more molecular in what they actually wanted. Or maybe they just got 500 applicants. Very broad biology search at a prestigious SLAC in a low-cost-of-living blue state with a stable climate is a recipe for an incredibly competitive pool. 12) Official rejection received 12/5, wonder if this means an offer has been accepted? x4 13) @ 12 did you interview? Zoom or in-person? 12) Haha, no. Not even a letter request. 14) Rejection letter received 12/6 said they have ""nearly filled"" the position so sounds like they are in negotiations x2 12) Interesting. Did *you* interview?

There is some access to college-owned housing at below market rates. Portland has gotten more expensive in recent years and many faculty are in dual income households. 9) Has anyone had an issue submitting on Interfolio for this posting? I have uploaded all the required documents but it still lists it as 'documents missing' so it won't allow me to submit. I've used Interfolio many times before without this issue, so I'm sure I have it input correctly. Not sure if it is an issue with Interfolio at the moment or with this particular job. 10) SC here - please feel free to reach out or share details here I can make sure there's nothing awry on our end.  In particular I hope the OPTIONAL slot was made optional, not required, and wonder if this could be tripping you up.  Haven't otherwise heard problems from submissions to date.  I don't have access to the system yet though - so will check with HR if I can describe what to look for. 9) @10, thanks for responding. I think it was an interfolio issue not an issue with your ad.

(8) LOL, ""address important questions in invertebrate or vertebrate evolution"". Can anyone here suggest a few questions in vert/invert evolution that don't apply to non-animals? What is the role of teeth in diversification? How do eyes drive cognition? (9) As I understand it, this is a search for an evolutionary biologist (broadly defined)... who happens to work on invertebrates/vertebrates systems (notice that theoretical questions are mentioned). It seems that the questions can be anything within the scope of the search... 10) I just heard back from the chair of the search, turns out ANYONE that is an evolutionary biologist can apply (this includes PLANT folks too, as long as their core question fits within the scope of the search). So, yes, there is love for plants :) anyone that may be a good fit should apply! 11) Also, notice that, while there is no mention of a diversity statement in the description of the job part of the post, a diversity statement is REQUIRED (this is mentioned at the very bottom of the post). 11) ""as long as their core question fits within the scope of the search"" -- which is... all of evolution? Also, who's the search chair? 12) ""All of evolution"" -- YES. This is for a broad search for an evolutionary biologist. The chair is Brent Lockwood (bllockwo@uvm.edu ). 13) These broad ""evolutionary biology"" searches aren't that uncommon... if you work on evoution you should apply. Or talk to the chair if in doubt. Knowing and talking with people in the dept I know they care more about your cool questions than your system. 14)Looks like reference letters are due upfront, sigh why do they do this for generic searches... 15) @14, .. folks please read the ad carefully...

Just the contact info for recomenders. 16) @15 the actual application form asks you to fill them in, but it doesn't seem like it will request it automatically. 16) does anyone know the teaching load? (17) My guess would be 2-3 courses per year. 18) I've been told similar (2-3 courses) by someone in the department. Also warned that salary is comparatively low with little room for negotiation (~$70k if I remember right) 18) UGH; 19) any updates? have they requested the letters of reference yet? 20) Nothing here x10 21) @19 here, phew, I was worried 21) IME, less than 1 month after the deadline is way too early to hear anything from them 22) it is one thing to hear back but another to know if they have requested letters from reference 23) based on my experience last year, a month is early for either thing. 24) Invitation for Zoom interview Oct 2 x5 (25) Wow, before letters?! 26) Out iof curiosity: those invited for interview, what is (in your own opinion) the most ""prestigious"" journal you've published in? 27) American Journal of Potato Research for me 28) Nothing higher than 4 or 5 impact factor, just journals relevant to my field and impactful for the community. 29) @26 Proc B? eLife? Other than that all evo bio journals: Mol Biol Evol, Syst Biol, Methods in Ecol & Evol, Evolution, so nothing fancy. 30) Heads up, got an invite and letter requests were sent out Oct 3-- @26 Evolution and AmNat here (3 total in those). 31) @ 26, PNAS. Have 12 first-author pubs ranging from PLOS One to PNAS, though been mostly publishing in MBE recently. Also, NIH K99 money...and yes I am an evolutionary biologist. Just convinced them to fund stuff that is evol bio related. (32) Any of you work on plants?

I just looked at the candidates and it seems that only 1/4 is in a permanent asst prof position. Funny enough, one of them is a 'presumed' internal candidate from one of the other jobs on this board. lol. 37) Yeah, it's one asst prof, one postdoc, one VAP, and one ""research scientist"" (though seems to run their own lab so close-ish to an asst prof) 38) Doubt that is true for the last one if by close-ish you mean a non soft money job with stability. They are basically attached to another lab at the school as former postdoc and that is a normal title for someone who is phased out of postdoc or needs to get PI status for grants. 37) Fair enough.","39","Match, exact","University of Vermont","VT",231174,"Burlington","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: STEM-dominant","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Small","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,2447,474,51,181,0,3153,178828,12319,76,572,7,0,33,11,40,11,204,451,1140,1307,0,0,13548,15903,13292,12326,11136,2156,10198,387,37,514,1608,548,2465,22,291,18,NA,NA,25,51,NA,494,0.156676,70,61,32,0.457143,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,18,8,5872,1959,745,590,570,1160,26,24,24.551036,18569,13244,0.713232,3

While occasionally, visitors have been hired for open tenure lines, it is the exception and not the rule.  8) Regarding teaching load:  I believe the teaching load is 13.5 credits a year.  One example of how this roughly works is to teach ~2 sections of a (often the same) course one semester (6 credits; e.g., 2 sections of intro bio) and an upper division lab that you would prep the second semester (e.g., lecture + lab for the same course; ~7 credits).  Every few years you may need to take on an extra section of a pre-prepped lab to make up that extra half credit.  9) Search committee member - Regarding non-vertebrates: while the candidate would need to teach vertebrate anatomy, their past or future study systems are not limited to vertebrates 10) any updates?

I heard through grapevine that shortlisting was difficult for this one. 5 were interviewed, top candidate was offered the job, but used it to negotiate better terms in their country. This took 1-2 months. 2nd-highest canidate was offered the job, turned it down because they are a postdoc and want to remain fully research-focused - this one does need a new Msc-level module. **I would strongly encourage past applicants to apply** - when there are are 50+ candidates, half of them are typically excellent... so the shortlisting process isn't random but its hard for it to be great - but one shouldn't interpret not being shortlisted as a rejection. 4) Recently my university hosted a researcher working at the School of Biological & Behavioural Sciences working in this particular field and in an informal conversation sHe expressed a very good impression of the departmentand and working conditions. We all know too well that universities positions not usually represent those of the departments and groups within. 5) Contrary to popular belief, the top candidate for the job did not negotiate a better position at their home university.

I'd apply if it got me a tour of the former rocket launch room. 5) The field of research is properly called ""Astrobiology"". ""Space Biology"" makes it seem like they're looking for a GIS tech. x2  6) Seriously, check out NASA's Exobiology program. There are a lot of opportunities for contemporary ecology, but it's not on a lot of folks' radar. 7) there are some pretty solid people in this dept, but also issues...as for the loose boundary between Exobiology (formerly Astrobiology) and Space Biology, NASA re-structured its funding divisions and moved human related research (Space Biology) into the general science funding pool, with the increased push for manned missions and the effects on humans (ionizing radiation is a biggy in this field) the center of Space Biology is shifting to microbial research and away from animal models...but that could change again.

In response (I am affiliated with the marine science program at St. Mary's College of Maryland) The marine science department is new, first recruited class started FA22, Fall 23 we are looking at more than doubling enrollment. We are increasing faculty & resources to keep up with increasing enrollment. Marine Science has only had one search. It was successful. More info about staffing is on our website. All the statements about previous cluster hires and other organismal and integrative bio hires is not from the marine science deparment. Those were in the biology department which does not oversee the marine science program. Diversity is broadly defined at SMCM, hence the perceived vagueness in advertisement. 5) Any updates as of 10/26? x2 6.) NOTHING as of 10/30 x3 7.)

Good Luck everyone! (Again) 2) UCSB had a similar position 3.5 years ago but it looks like no freshwater person in the department. Was that never filled or did that hire leave? x2 3) letters must be requested by the due date 4) I would've thought there'd be better salary support in such a high COL area 5) Based on other recent hires in UC system I know, I expect its in the mid to high end of that range for EEB hires. See the line about ""off-scale salaries"" 5) dept member here, @2 that search failed, an offer was made but the person went elsewhere, so we are re-running the search. @5, I can confirm that salaries for those recently hired are very much on the upper end of the quoted range. 6) how soon after review date would you prefer letters turned in? 7) @6 Search committee member here - ASAP on the letters please, 8) any news? x4 9) WE WANT NEWS x5 10) it's been over six weeks, so I'm guessing they already conducted or at least sent out requests form Zoom interviews? 10) @9 not me. 11) I wouldn't count this out if no one here has reported an update. UCSB is on quarter system, so they're only just started the academic year and I've seen searches take over two months after deadline for a first update x2 12) I'm not on the SC but am in this dept and no, no invites (zoom or otherwise) have been sent out. @11 is right that the quater just started, and we have a somewhat lengthy process with getting interviewees approved before we can send invites. 13) Thanks for that info! Any idea of the timeline here? x7 14) Heard about folks recieving interview requests x2 15) How did you hear about the interviews? 16) Same question - has anyone here actually gotten an interview invite? I heard from folks at UCSB just a few days ago that the search was going very slowly 17) not me x6 18) I wonder why it has gone so slowly 19) invterview invitation received week of the 13th x2 20) no zoom interview? 21) nope, no zooms x2","11","Match, partial","University of California-Santa Barbara","CA",110705,"Santa Barbara","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences focus, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Suburb Midsize","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No",0,7063,570,298,0,0,7931,241523,12911,527,882,41,52,179,26,272,26,414,156,6374,689,0,0,26314,28096,26179,25562.333333,23196,2983,22480,686,0,30,2774,209,4813,34,2351,102,NA,NA,19,45,NA,2063,0.260119,52,80,37,0.711538,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,18,17,9665,3957,1865,620,610,1230,28,25,25.96101,90961,33384,0.367014,3
