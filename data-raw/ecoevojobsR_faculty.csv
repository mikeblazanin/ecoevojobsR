Seems overly restrictive 2) It means ""at least 6 months"". Presumably they don't want to hire anyone who's ABD, and so wrote the ad so as to rule out ABD candidates. 3) ecoevojobs.net commenters reading a broad ad with few details: ""Boo! Be specific!"" ecoevojobs.net commenters reading a specific, detailed ad: ""Boo! Overly restrictive!"" 4) The specifics people want are about job details, not extra arbitrary restrictions on eligibility. 5) Requiring postdoc experience is extremely normal for a TT search in the sciences. Hardly an arbitrary restriction. x6 6) You really think 0 vs 6 months of postdoc experience makes any tangible difference in a candidate's ability to do this job? Most ads say postdoc experience preferred which at least leaves room for flexibility. 7) @6 yes it does! It means you have now graduated and are able to reach out to potential collaborators, think of a project, perhaps discuss funding related things, and have started to understand how things work on the other side of the wall. If you are asking this question... perhaps you need some more months as postdoc to asnwer it by yourself. 6) Lol 7, I've got plenty of postdoc and PI experience. Requiring a completed PhD is one thing. 6 months into a postdoc you have probably just finished actually getting moved and figuring out what your new lab even does. 7) Many comments on this board imply that the people who wrote the ad are incompetent at their jobs; this comment thread is just one example of many. I would be genuinely curious to hear comments from people who ended up taking jobs for which there are comments on this board implying that that the members of the hiring department are incompetent. Did they actually turn out to be incompetent once you showed up on campus and started working with them? 8) If you see something oddly specific in a job ad it's almost always either a compromise or some weird HR restriction. Don't overthink it. If the job ad said ""PhD completed"" people would waffle about whether that meant ""graduated"" versus ""defended."" Being partway into a postdoc means you've secured said postdoc, which is in and of itself representative of something useful. 9) Many times language in the job ad is polished by HR. So... instead of asking you must have a completed PhD by the time of hire, HR may suggest, just request a postdoc... that way you dont have to dsicriminate through applicants and end up offering the job to someone that will have to wait another 6 months to graduate. People in this forum overthink things too much... and complain for no reason. The other day someone was complaining about a job in THE FRENCH part of Canada requiring proficience in French.

This sounds like american fluff for nothing 2) Current postdoc here and no, these Research Associate positions are not postdocs! They function a bit differently, pay better, and (from what I have seen, I don't know what the exact situation with this one is obviously) tend to be/ tend to lead to more permanent postitions than a postdoc where the expectation is that you move on at the end of the term. 3) Sounds like a cool gig!  4) @2 it's one year, extendable to three, you're doing mostly research and you have a supervisor. What makes this different from a postdoc except the salary? 5) Former CLO person here. Research Associate positions are essentially PI positions – you run your own research program, but without some of the tedium and BS that comes from running your own lab (sort of unfortunate that the title doesn't properly convey the status). You're a bit buffered by Cornell, pretty cushy in that way. You won't get your own physical lab space, but you have access to many great shared spaces. Expectations are similar to what they are for faculty at many research-intensive institutions. Cornell always offers ""one year, renewable"" contracts, so this isn't unusual. Check the list of current Research Associates on their website...these folks are doing stellar work. No teaching either. A dream position for the right person. 6) also former recent CLO person. Research associate is a catchall title that can be a position like 5 describes (rare) but can be much more like a postdoc contract that expires. Still looks like a nice position but I wouldn't count on it being long term or would at least ask a lot of questions. 7) Basically it is a non-tenure track research professor. X2 8) Cornell person here. RA roles function more like higher-paid postdocs as Cornell has tightened PI eligibility. I’d clarify whether this position includes PI status. 9) Does this position require 100k USD payment for people from outside the US? 10) Not associated with Cornell in any way. But generally speaking, if you are a non-US citizen currently in the US and if Cornell is willing to sponsor H1-Bs, the 100k fee most likely won't apply. If you are a non-US citizen currently not living in the US, it most likely will apply. They probably won't proceed with a H1-B process in such a scenario anyway.

There are no established internal funding mechanisms for graduate students, they all must be grant supported or you can co-advise with a faculty member at a consortium university that has access to TAships. You are expected to co-teach 1 semester course a year and contribute to the internship programs we provide for undergraduates over the summer.

Yes, the salary is similar to ""Lecturer"" in the SUNY system and SUNY employee salaries are public 7) No visa sponsorship?

This tells me a lot about the department culture and I would steer well-clear if you value a better, less-metric driven academia. If you relish this kind of environment, good luck 3) Honestly, these would be an advantage pretty much anywhere. At least they are honest about it. 4) Beware! Notoriously rigged searches with jobs going to internal candidates. Swedish Universities concentrate too much power in department leadership (Chair,Heads) resulting in serious abuse of authority. There is hardly any national-level funding for PhD students, resulting in a growing national crisis. A PI is lucky to even manage one PhD student. Pathetic salaries and startup.One of these departments has a serious reputation for work-place toxicity. 5) I almost appreciate the obnoxious honesty of the ""desirable qualifications"" of CNS and a PhD from a ""internationally leading university"" 6) there are some very broad generalizations above, and Uppsala has a great eco-evo group where several colleagues have spent sabbaticals to escape their own toxic departments 3) @ 4 That is not my experience of the Evo Eco departments at Uppsala at all! Searches have been so incredibly fair with hardly any internal committee members to avoid internal preferences. The only downside is the searches are very slow, and many of the best applicants accept a job elsewhere before the short list is announced. 7) @3 - in your experience, is this a matter of 3-4 months, or 6+ month timelines to shortlist? thanks! 8) in my case at one of these departments (IEG) the shortlist was within 3 months, interview at 4-5 months postapp. Also, as a new PI here I can gurantee that it's an extremely collaborative & friendly environment, that cares more about people being happy than the journals where they publish. I agree the wording of the ad is a bit unfortunate, but that's what happens when the calls come from high up / combining several depts. The start-up package is going to be very generous and salaries in relation to cost of living are extremely competitive (& you can get expert tax relief for 7 years). Happy to talk to anyone about their questions gabriela.montejo-kovacevich@scilifelab.uu.se . PS in reply to @4 internal candidates are excluded from this search because of the requirements + long/shortlists, panel reports etc are public + panels rarely have members from the departments involved, so the system is as fair as it can be imo. 4) Interested candidates are seriously encouraged to make an effort to verify the work culture with past researchers/faculty who have left these programs in this institution, and there are quite a few. There is a tendency to stifle whistle-blowers who are seen as trouble-makers, leaving them little choice but to leave the institution. In fact some programs are largely made up of a senior PI and junior faculty who were their ex-postdocs or PhD students. Past searches posted from earlier years at ecoevojobs.net have alluded to the very same problems. @2 - you are right to pick up on the red flags. 9) I agree with @4 that you should directly reach out to current PIs to ask about the environment in the departments instead of comming to share rumors and hear-say to EcoEvoJobs. Things have changed in Uppsala depts, problematic people have been pushed out and moved on to other positions; in another case an entire department was dissolved due to misconduct, etc. On the other hand, it is not my experience that PIs don't have generous starts-ups in Sweden and can't afford PhD students or even Postdocs or Senior Researchers (I am a recent PI in Sweden). PhD students are expensive in Sweden because they are contracted workers with full social benefits (as they should be!). 10) I work at IEG. This is a very special recruitment, being open for all of Biology which is why the ad is not quite what we are used to in our field. What is said above about ""toxicity"" etc is outdated and incorrect - there used to be ""cultural problems"" in one of the (many) research programs, but these were reconciled several years ago. In most program, the research enviroment is very nice, stimulating and supportive and the ""problem"", if any, is that people want to stay rather than leave. All in all, it's a very supportive and stimulating environment indeed. Also, this position would come with a very generous start-up/support by any standards. I strongly recommend people interested to contact people that actually work here, rather than leaning on the outdated rumours and incorrect information above. 4) ) Image is everything for Swedish academic institutions, so a lot of narrative spinning in the earlier commnets. These are not ""outdated rumors"" but ever-present and continuing issues. Repeated investigation by independent bodies and unions reinforce the negative academic atmosphere in Sweden. These are serious considerations that impact the life and careers of academics so awareness is important. Applicants should contact past employees to get an unbiased picture, not currently employed ones who have vested interests. Some links to important findings that have bearing are provided. https://www.gu.se/en/news/threats-and-harassment-common-in-swedish-academia, https://aardvarchaeology.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/swedish-academia-is-no-meritocracy/, https://theconversation.com/swedish-academics-suffer-widespread-threat-and-harassment-most-of-it-from-their-own-colleagues-and-students-245602. 11) wow someone needs to chill out. x7 10) I am sorry to see that someone (ie 4)) apparently has such bad experience of Sweden and the Swedish academic system. Having worked here for 20 years myself, as well as in several other countries, my experience is that Sweden is a very decent place both to live in and for academic work when related to most other countries. https://explore.sweden.se/research-in-sweden/doing-research-in-sweden","1","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two external, substantive grant applications per year and productive publication activity are expected. 1) Was this a search from last year that failed? Anyone can chyme in on what it's like living in this area, cost of living, and collegiality of the department? 2) This is a restarted search. Buffalo is a low cost of living small city, many of the benefits of a large city without traffic or especially high costs. Though the housing market is competitive. 3) if im remembering correctly this search was canceled shortly after this administration started cutting funding, maybe it will stick this time? 4) What's the salary? 5) This is an R2? What's research opportunities like for grad students in the Biology Department? x 2 6) There is a graduate program in the biology department for masters students and also a great lakes center graduate program for masters students. Typically masters students get a small stipend if they are awarded a TA/GA line. 7) I disagree with the above comment on cost of living in Buffalo - I think this was the case ~10 years ago, but recently, everything is very pricey.

Unprofessional and toxic 5) @4 sounds like they are not alone, though 6) would love to hear additional perspectives if there are any other former employees here x1 7) As a former employee, I would generally agree with 2); the CEO told me when I started that he prefers to run his non-profit like a for-profit and everyone that had written the (somewhat unrealistic) grants I was working on had left before I started. This environment does work for some, and I think other groups within the org have more freedom 8) thanks for your perspective!!!  8) Warnings expressed above match my observations while collaborating on a project with this group, and discussions with several (now former) employees.","","Unmatched",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I'm sorry to say, but as a small institution and this is a 1 yr, non-TT contract position, I don't think Macalester has the capacity for OPT STEM for this job. I don't know the details, but know that HR probably added that language. If you have follow up questions, you can email the chair of the search wells@macalester.edu 3) I'm not 1, but OPT STEM requires no financial commitment from the employer and employment can vary in length as long as the student continuously remains employed (even by varied employers or going from job to job). I find it confusing that not having the capacity for it is cited as the reason, as even volunteering can be deemed an acceptable use of the OPT. 4) If the employer is not enrolled in eVerify, they cannot sponsor STEM OPT 5) Probably has to do with eVerify. The employer doesn't ""sponsor"" or is otherwise  involved with OPT (other tthan verifying eligibility to work through I9, whichis done for all employees including US citizens), so seems like they are just letting folks know that working for them would not meet valid employment criteria for someone on OPT.  6) Hi - #2 again.

Busses? 2) There are busses that go from parts of Brooklyn to Staten Island, but CSI is a little out of the way and requires a bus transfer in Staten Island. Also, some parts of Brooklyn are not served by the bus that goes to Staten Island, and so you'll need to transfer to get to even that first bus. Really depends on the Brooklyn neighborhood how much easier a car will make the trip. 3) Having a car is really a part of life for the outer boroughs (Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island), except for their most urban areas (i.e., those next to Manhattan or along a useful subway line - which is nil in Staten Island), especially if you both live AND work outside of Manhattan. You could technically rely on public transportation all across NYC, but life is just better with a car and you are not at the mercy of the MTA (esp. late nights, weekends, holidays, bad weather). If you can afford one, have one. New Yorkers know. 4) Do folks here commonly have graduate students through the Graduate Center? Or would research mentorship be primarily with undergrads? 5) CSI awards up to masters degrees, CUNY PhD students come from the Grad Center but can do research at a campus like CSI and be mentored by faculty there. 4) @1 -- one thing no one has mentioned yet is that the commute from BK to SI over the Verrazzano is expensive -- like $11 5) Can confirm.

If you want to vent about salaries in general, that's what the Venting tab is for. x11 3) I'd love to compare the distribution of actual faculty salaries with expectations from anonymous candidates on this board 4) You'd find that people who complain about salaries on this board expect salaries much higher than most places offer. And then you'd have an endless argument about whether those expectations are reasonable/justified. Are the people who complain about salaries on this board naive and unrealistic? Or are they clear-eyed critics of systemic exploitation of workers by employers? 5) Several NAU faculty have left the city/university because they couldn't buy a house in Flagstaff with faculty salary as the main income in the household. It's a pretty expensive town and not a lot of opportunities for trailing spouses. In comparison, 150 miles away the Phoenix area is the big city (culture, population, international airport) in the state but it's about 40% cheaper to live there (i.e., postdocs can buy houses). Having said that, it's lovely and NAU has done a good job with a recent R2-R1 transition. 6) @2 and kinda @4: I'm not @1, but the reason why I usually post info about salaries in the notes is because it's an incredibly imporant consideration (@5 shows one of the many reasons why this is the case). Simply saying ""you're just naive"" or ""just shut up and don't apply"" isn't conducive to bringing about change in hiring practices and pay for everyone across the board. Who cares about expectations? We ALL deserve higher wages. Punch up, not down or sideways. Solidarity. x2 6) Looking forward to someone spelling out the causal pathway from posting on this anonymous jobs board to higher salaries. Like, how is that supposed to work? Like, I can totally see how union organizing would lead to higher salaries. Or voting and political organizing on behalf of state officials who support higher education, absolutely. But...posting...on...ecoevojobs.net? What does that accomplish? 7) I'm sure Flagstaff is disproportionately expensive like @5 said, but postdocs are absolutely not buying houses in Phoenix lmao. Unless you're now considering Apache Junction and Casa Grande part of Phoenix, or have Phoenix confused with Tucson which is a much more LCOL city? Source: Phoenix postdoc renting with roommates because ASU salaries have in no way kept up with the ever increasing cost of living 8) There are ways to fight for change that don't involve clogging every discussion of every job posting with salary venting when there is a dedicated place for that. 7) But, but, if I don't complain about salaries here rather than on the Venting page, how will I generate solidarity? 9) Amen 5 again) @7, not every postdoc, esp. in ecology I guess, but I know/knew a few/was one that could. Some postdoc salaries are pretty high at ASU (like, way higher than NIH scale in the more bio-meddy institutes like Biodesign) and there are several career-track pathways that PIs use to move postdocs to higher salaries to keep them around. Anyway, perhaps not downtown PHX or some of the swankier neighborhoods, but definitely across the greater metro area, Phoenix is one of the most affordable big US cities. Flagstaff not so much, salaries are lower and the cost of housing is super high. There's not a lot of inventory since Flagstaff is surrounded by federal land, while PHX is flush with new inventory which keeps prices lower. 10) rejection email 1/26 x2 11) kind of puzzles me why only a cover letter was required 12) Does anyone who know who were the faculty that left NAU recently? @5","2","Match, exact","Northern Arizona University","AZ",105330,"Flagstaff","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, inclusive, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Southwest AZ NM OK TX","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Small","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,6403,1276,71,142,0,7892,62548,1908,45,748,6,6,18,41,30,41,260,1158,2627,3776,0,48,30733,34290,29566,25102,25228,4338,20642,4238,0,348,2228,2110,4589,628,1614,703,NA,NA,25,51,NA,1247,0.158008,69,73,34,0.492754,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,18,9,10144,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37386,30523,0.816429,1

The 9 months of endowment is easy to understand, but why time-limited? Does the department just not have any funds or intent to support further, and if so, wouldn't it make more sense as a postdoc/multiple postdocs? 2) Not involved there, but at our university, this would mean someone donated funds for an Endowed Professorship. Thus, the funds would be restricted to that 2) are you interpretting that it is time-limited because it says it is a 12-month position? I interpret that not as being the length of the term of the position, just that you are expected to be there working 12 months a year, even though they only have money to pay you for 9 months - which is the standard gig for most faculty, except you usually don't have to be available in the summer, whereas here you would. 3) unsure of the confusion and not my area and not at UW but...it says 12 months with 9 months salary being the endowment and the 3 months coming from grants. Fairly standard R1 expectation where you are responsible for summer salary and the expectation is you work all year. OP) I know what a 9mo salary is, I meant the part about ""The initial appointment of an Assistant Professor WOT is typically for a period of three years. Renewal for a second three-year term will be considered by SAFS and the College of the Environment spring quarter of the second year."" Therefore this is a temporary position. The people the endowment is named for are alive, so the intent doesn't make sense to hire faculty for possibly only 3 years, maximum 6. 4) Not sure what the confusion is about. This seems like EXTREMELY STANDARD language for this type of job. Literally no one is hired for a long-term job without an initial review period. x2 5) yes that seems like pretty standard pre-tenure/non-tenure contract structure in the US x2 6) I have been on the beat a while and was also confused by the language OP x3. 7) I assume it is permanent insofar as other non-tenure line faculty are permanent with regular review periods; worth clarifying before moving your life to a remote albeit gorgeous island.  8) U WOT M8? x2 lmao 9) I am also confused #6 and OP. If anyone from UW shows up here, do they know how visas would work for this? No green card, if not permanent? 10) my take is this is a soft money position at Friday Harbor (not main campus) with 3 year contract extensions; it's non-tenure track because the position is not being paid from recurring funds from the SAFS department annual budget, it's reliant on the endowment to continue generating the 9 month AY salary, and the selected candidate being able to bring in their 3 months of summer salary on external grants...so it seems like a relatively hard, soft money position 11) I think I saw similar three-year term language in a separate job ad and think it's just how UW does things. 12) It just looks like a permanent non tenure track position (thats how named endowed chairs work) that pays a pretty good 9 month salary (they list 116-170k/9-month to start in the ad) and you can increase that salary by getting your own grants to add more months of summer salary. Reviews and renewals are standard for all kinds of positions including pre-tenure TT positions. Honestly seems like a pretty great job all the comments here are strange. x4 13) I would gladly take this job over most TT jobs. Wish it was a better fit for me. 14) Perhaps people are asking questions because they haven't seen this type of appointment before and are curious precisely because it looks like a great job, a smidge of empathy goes a long way. x2 15) Genuine question: why don't people ever just email the search chair with these questions (and then report back, if the goal is to get answers for the community)? 16) Updated app to include question about visa status, got an email to answer the new question by 2/6 end of day ""do you now or will require in the future visa sponsorship?""  17) any word fam?

The previous expectations were that the director would be on site for the majority of the year so you would be out on an island away from Missoula.

We are looking for someone who can cover some of the courses listed whether that person is an aquatic ecologist or not 4) why say ""aquatic ecologist"" when its clear that's not what is desired? 5) SC chair here - I disagree that it's clear that's not what is desired. The position is to replace an outgoing aquatic ecologist so that specialty would be a natural fit but isn't absolutely required of the position","","Match, exact","Saint Mary's University of Minnesota","MN",174817,"Winona","Doctoral/Professional Universities","Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Professional-dominant","Four-year, medium full-time, inclusive, lower transfer-in","Majority graduate","Four-year, medium, primarily residential","Not Classified","Plains IA KS MN MO NE ND SD","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Town Distant","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,417,1234,31,12,0,1694,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,31,40,1206,92,325,0,1,5548,6947,5152,4118.666667,1329,3823,1049,266,3,11,2550,1273,239,0,29,68,NA,NA,20,13,NA,532,0.31405,43,29,9,0.209302,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,10,2,1057,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1459,1227,0.840987,1

From last year's spreadsheet it seems candidates were never rejected :( 5) I'm think they suspended the search for budget reasons last year.6) @4, this seems to be common, there are a bunch of places I've applied to and never gotten a rejection. 7) @4,5 Dept member not involved in either SC, last year’s search for the TT faculty position was successful (not suspended due to budget issues) and has been filled. Shame to hear about applicants not being notified. 8) SC member: review date is Jan 16.  Trying to add this to the posting...9) Have heard some rumors about funding challenges and departmental restructuring. Can someone in the department speak to these? Also, is there the possibility to track switch in this position (i.e., to tenure track?).  10) Can confirm that last year's search was no good  AP) @9, the job ad says ""Position Type: Non tenure-track faculty"" at the top and @1's description doesn't sound like a tenure-track position. x2 11) SC member: this is an NTT job - no inside track to a TT position; I'm sorry to hear that applicants to a different position in the department weren't notified of decisions.  I wasn't involved in that search, but I'll make sure that doesn't happen this time. 12) Will whomever fills this role be able to have a research program?

Should folks with qualifications that span both positions apply separately for each? 2) I think with the way our system is set up, that probably makes the most sense.

I know in Quebec there is the expectation to learn french based on the other discussions here. But just curious as to whether an application would not be considered if it was written in english? 2) Sherbrooke is a university that teaches only in French so you will have to learn French really quickly if you don't already to meet the job requirements. 3) in principle this is okay but it demonstrates your ability to speak french and if a candidate is as good or a bit less good as you but is fluent in french, they will probably take the french-speaking candidate. If you in your statement write in a convincing way that you will learn french in principle you should be good. 4) JFC people, are we going to have this discussion on every single post from a French-speaking university??? Job applications should be written in the working language of the university/institute/etc you are applying to. If you don't have the fluency to do that, it is a big flashing sign that the job probably is not for you. 1) The job requirements don't say that you have to have french fluency but just have to be able to rapidly learn - they provide the ad in both English and French so I wasn't sure if there is an expectation one way or the other. My husband/in-laws are francophones but just my french at this point is not ""fluent"" but would easily get to that point if I was in an immersive environment. While I could prepare my application in French with support/help it doesn't feel honest of my current french status which I would not want to misadvertise. 5) Yeah, this is a totally reasonable question for a university in QC, in particular because the biggest universities in the province deliver their programming in english. 4) @5 The biggest university in Quebec is UQAM, where instruction is in French. * I meant  to say Université de Montréal, not UQAM. 6) @4, you are right and I agree. However, if the job as is in either in both english and french, I would assume applying in English is OK. It is up to the SC to assess the ability to learn or speak french. Vive le Québec 7) Imagine if for every job in the US people asked ""am I OK if I say I'll lrean English really fast?"" ""Should the materials be in English, or am I OK providing them in Spanish (there are 42M native spanish speakers in the US)?"" 8) @7 Many of these Quebec jobs explicitly say that candidates can learn French and that fluency for the position is not a prerequisite so this isn't an accurate comparison. Taken directly from this job ad specifically: ""Professors at the Université de Sherbrooke are expected to be able to teach in French, or to rapidly attain the ability to do so. An institutional learning support program is offered to all new faculty wishing to learn French."". This implies that they are willing to consider candidates that don't have french fluency despite their location. 7) Yes, just like for US universities it is assumed that you can't teach in Spanish (unless otherwise specified), for QC universities we can assume the same (French unless otherwise specified), follow whatever is specified on the job ad (which you very kindly cited), and move on, instead of cluttering the Notes section of every freaking job where English teaching is not an absolute given... x2 1) My question was about applications not requirements for the position. I can read a job ad and can see that French is required (not to mention that the job is in QC). I just wasn't sure if these applications were expected to be prepared in one language over the other as I have not applied to any job in QC before.  The job ad does not say whether the application should be prepared in English or French which is why I even posted my question - not to discuss whether I _actually_ need to speak french.

[article on FORMER chief scientist removed -AP] 2) Start date negotiable but as soon as possible! 3) The chief scientist is gone but the museum leadership that drove away most of the science staff of the museum is still there.

But I have absolutely no experience as a curator. :( x2 4.) This job isn't listed on the Museum's employment website. That seems a little strange. Is that normal for museums? 5) Former CMNH CM here, I would caution anyone interested in this position. I've been out of that place for a year and a half, and hopefully they are making improvements, but it was an incredibly toxic environment. As far as I know, this would be the only curator over the inverts, herbarium, and vert zoo collection. Their priorities are out of line and they gatekeep their collections. 6) Thanks to folks who shared that link and insights about the culture - bummer to hear and I'm sorry you had an awful experience @5. I assume that all applies for the ornithology position too? Thoughts on how to assess meaningful vs. just surface-level improvements? 5) Yes, this would apply for the ornitiology position as well. I would try and talk to other folks that are not on the hiring committee/real employees if you can find their emails/info. The Natural Areas/CMs/Wildlife crew would give you insight, I think. 2) current employee, things have significantly improved and new hires are part of revitalization. Recommend talking to current curators about the job if you have questions. No previous curation experience needed (collections staff take care of day to day), looking for researchers interested in working in a museum setting! (7) is this position also visa eligible like the above one? 2) Yes visa eligible, and the Museum has sponsored/paid for green cards for curators in the past 8) Does anyone know a contact for additional information about this position? 2) You can email questions to research[at]cmnh.org which goes to current curators (9) I applied to this but the form/application seems to go through a recruiting company... anyone from the SC here that could comment on if you are seeing the applications that come through or how to confirm? x2 2) Using a recruitment firm but can confirm applications are being reviewed by museum staff as they come in 9) 12/11 -I was contacted by the recruiting company about scheudling an interivew. x3 10) 12/15 - I was also contacted for an interview. 11) Have any of you heard back?  I got an email to schedule an interview but have heard nothing since then (it's been several days) x2 10) @11 That's weird. I heard back from the recruiting firm within 24 hours of my reply and have scheduled an interview with them. I would send a follow-up email. 12) Same here; received an email to schedule an interview, answered and nothing since (it was last week). 10) was your invitation through the HR company or directly through the museum? My emails have been with the HR company.  12) with the recruiting company 13) Anyone heard anything? 14) not here - had an interview with the recruiting company a while ago but no news x2 15) at my interview the recruiter said they would be conducting more interviews in early Jan, so I expect we'll hear back in the next week or two 16) I had a 2nd interview last week. any updates? 17) @16) nothing here, but I still haven't heard anything since my first interview with the HR company over a month ago.

I hope it was the former. 5) @4 - simply saying that it no longer says this would be sufficient, assume the best, after all we're promoting an inclusive environment, and such assumptions go against such efforts X3 [plus a ""hell yes""]. 6) Heads up the application requires you to submit an 'other' document whose identity is not specified, no guidance in the job ad. 7) @6 I believe that is for the 3 PDFs of publications they are requesting in the job ad. 8) any updates as of 12/30? 9) none x8 10) >350 apps, give it a minute... 11) Not to frustrate our insider, but looks like the 10x applications index is accurate once again! 12) how do we know app #? 13) @12 rule of thumb is 10x the number in the 'number applied' column. 14) the unoffical number was 370 applications, so it'll take a bit. 15) 370 apps sounds wild, is this typical for this department? 16) My guess is the very high number is also driven by a combination of A) decent sized city and B) incredibly broad call. 17) Zoom invites have been sent according to Future PI sheet 18) zoom interview invite 1/16; 19) Rejection email today 22/1 -- it was a nice cute email, which was a positive! I once got a handsigned letter! x4 20) Anyone willing to share their field who got an interview? 21) Anyone get on-site invite yet?

Happy to answer questions about the college, university, and general workload. 3) Congrats 2 - Have you heard about visa sponsorship for tenure stream faculty recently? 2) @3 unfortunately no. We are also still in a temporary hiring freeze (the state is shifting HR systems) so many things are in flux with hiring. 4) The hiring freeze is only through Nov and will not effect this job. As for H1B support, the university has paid fees for H1Bs as recently as 6 months ago, but it is not clear how the new fee structure will change things or whether it will still be in place by the time this is offered. I would apply if you're interested. There are additional jobs in related fields that will be posted soon. 5) Since there are other jobs being posted soon, if we are a terrestrial ecologist should we hold off for those? (I know this is a stupid question but working at URI is a dream) 4) I don't think a terrestrial ecologist would be considered in this search as the goal is soemone who can develop a specific program and use specific infrastructure. I don't think terrestrial ecology will be one of the jobs posted this year. 6) @4, what specific infrastructure might this be? x2 4) Sorry, posted this yestderay and it's gone now, but there are opportunites to use facilities on the GSO campus, but it is not a requirement of the job. 1 again) non commital response from HR - so maybe(?!?) on H-1B though it feels like having to drop 100k on a visa would be an easy way to remove people from applicate pool (I guess I am cynical this year...): ""Visa sponsorship may be available for certain positions at the University of Rhode Island, depending on business needs at the time of hire. Sponsorship decisions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis in consultation with our immigration counsel."" 4) I did get some clarity on the H1B that if applicants are in the US already on a different status, the $100k fee does not apply.

I wasn't sure. Pivotal place to have a typo. 15) Considering the article specifies that the hiring freeze adheres to fiscal year 2026 (ending in June '26) and that graduate students and temp workers are in the same list as Fall '26 TT hires, I think the typo is meant to say ""not."" That being said, if the proposal to increase URI's budget cap for FY27 fails, the hiring freeze may continue?

Is this referring to visas? 2) Likely, but not on SC 3) 1 again - could someone from the SC confirm that? Or if anyone knows who the SC chair (or other members) is, please share. I could write to them and find out. I think the international folks here would appreciate knowing if it is worth applying for this position. 4) Emailed HR and they said ""We have recently reached out to the Chancellor's Office for guidance on this matter and will provide you with an update as soon as we receive a response."" 5) @4- Thank you! Please let us know if/when you hear back. The same policy will apply to the other two CSUMB jobs on this board, so their response should be of interest to a lot of folks. 6) In Florida we we told we had to inculde verbiage in postings explicitly stating we [the Uni] would not sponsor individuals requiring visas; the justification we were given was, H1-B visas now cost $100K 7) That is only true for H1-B applicants currently outside the US and applying for a H1-B from outside the US. The fee is not applicable to H1-B applicants currently in the US. That distinction is crucial for postdocs who are already here and are trying to build careers here. I wish university HRs would understand this. 8) @7 could you provide a link to the policy language you're referencing? I think there's a lot of confusion around renewals, extensions, and changes to employer that would be worth clarifying; 9) I am not 7, but I saw that proclamation. Found the link with info: ""The Proclamation applies to new H-1B petitions filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, on behalf of beneficiaries who are outside the United States and do not have a valid H-1B visa. The Proclamation also applies if a petition filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, requests consular notification, port of entry notification, or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States."" https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations. 10) 7 again: Yes, the original order came on Sept 19 or 20 (I don't remember exactly), but a lot of things were unclear back then including whether it would apply to extensions, renewals and changes of employers. USCIS issued new guidance on Oct 20 clarifying that it will only apply to applicants who are either outside the US or are in the US but are ineligible for extensions, renewals etc. Unfortunately, this distinction seems to have been completely lost in university admin perception, judging by the ads here. Here is a University of Michigan explainer on all of this: https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/about/news/updated-uscis-guidance-regarding-h-1b-proclamation-change-status-petitions-not-affected 4) UPDATE from HR: ""Cal State Monterey Bay is currently not sponsoring H-1B employment visas which are subject to the $100,000 fee established by the “Presidential Proclamation: Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers” issued on September 19, 2025.

""VCU is committed to supporting the success of its teaching faculty, who play a vital role in the university’s academic mission, and offers clear pathways for promotion to the ranks of Associate Professor and Professor."" 4) They might mean Associate Professor (Teaching) and Professor (Teaching) x3 5) Yes it looks like they have a teaching track that includes promotion and probably security of employment, but it would be pretty rare to be able to switch from one of these positions to tenure track. 6) FWIW have a friend who was non-tenure track in a different dept at VCU and was never provided with a promotion opportunity over the span of 10+ years despite excellent teaching reviews and tons of service work 7) this school directs all priorities to the medical campus, so there is not a lot of faculty support on this side of campus. little financial support for PhD students (I believe it's two years of support), much of their previous graduate program webpagess are outdated as well. 8) to the point raised by the previous commentor, that is not at all true; funding is now secured for graduate students for longer, though not as high as it should be pay-wise; there are set promotion schedules for TT and non-TT as long as one has a terminal degree, w/o a terminal degree previously there was not; the school of life sciences is a new merger between biology, bioinformatics, and environmental studies; this position would involve teaching a large lecture ecology course, managing TAs and labs, and pulling one additional speciatliy class per semester. 9) FWIW, these positions are to secure teaching lines for high enrollment courses for the biology major.

Lots of great research going on there. 2) I interviewed here last spring and the department (especially the eco/evo cluster) was so supportive and welcoming. 3) I regard CCNY as a prestigious place to work. Dream job to me. 4) SC: Faculty at CCNY become appointed to the CUNY Graduate Center which is R1, and comment #1 is correct. 5): sorry to be 'that guy', but can anyone comment on salary vs cost of living? I know some other NY schools have accomodation support but it seems like that isn't the case here? (don't get me wrong, i'll be applying regardles) 6) Cost of living is high in NYC, but you will certainly be able to survive on this salary. A lot of people commute from Jersey, the Bronx, Westchester, and even queens and brooklyn. CCNY is on several different subway and bus lines that make this possible. Will you be able to live on the upper west side, maybe not, but Harlem is also not so expensive as the rest of manhattan 5) thanks for hte context 6! 6) Assistant professor in this department has super strong research record. People caring if CCNY is R2 or R1 is quite ignorant about how things are going there. 7) That salary is definitely feasible to live in Manhattan (by yourself). I live in Manhattan on a similar salary 8) @6 chill out. No one was complaining about R1/R2 status, someone was just explaining the administrative structure x2; 9) Does anyone have info about the statement ""Candidates must be legally authorized to work full-time in the United States."" does this mean only apply if you ar a US citizen or already live and work there? :/ 10) @9, generally that means US citizens and permanent residents (green card holders) 11) @9 It's still worth applying for it if you have a strong profile! H1B application does not need 100k anymore if you are already in the states legally.  @10 & @11 Thanks for the clarification.

If so, can you speak to whether this is a new faculty line or replacing vacant line? 5) This is speculation but I note that Yoichiro Kanno's website says he'll be moving to U. Montana next spring.

Basically should I recommend my letter writers to submit within those 72 hours? 4) I applied, they reached out to me within 72 hours to fill in details for referees, but the letter writers have onger than that 5) from 3 thanks @4! 6) BTW the due date on this app has not changed..#2 might be thinking of a separate search in microbial cell biology - the microbiome science search is entirely distinct from that. 7) pretty sure this job was sent to ecolog 10/10 & the due date said 10/15? 8) If so then that was an error - the due date is Nov 2nd. 8) Top of the link says Nov 6. Does anyone know if they are still accepting applications?? 9) Emailed Matt Sullivan and got an autor reply. 9) Applications will be accepted through the 6th. 11) Any updates? 12) None here 12/12 13) coming from the future to warn us? @12 14) does anyone know when rec letters are due? 15) I think rec letters were already due, got an email at 11/6 that they had issues with their system asking to reenter the rec letter writer's details. They also reached out again last week (11/15) for a missing letter. 15) anyone invited for zoom interview? 16) not me at this time (Dec.3) x7 17) Nothing Dec 10th x7 18) Anyone heard as of Dec 19th? 19) Nothing here x6 20) Anyone from the department/search committee who can update us? 21) Was anyone brave enough to email the head of search committee? 22) I assume they moved forward and no one on ecoevo was a zoom finalist, because it is now so late in the timeline. 23)21 again. I initially thought that @22 but we are such an awesome bunch. At least one of us would've gotten a zoom. 24) agree with 22, they maybe wanted a more medically or industrially focused person. 25) I wouldn’t lose hope yet. This is a big cross-unit search and the delayed letters + holidays probably slowed things down. 26) lol someone be brave & ask for us! 27) okay, I emailed and got an autoreply - SC chair away this week 28) @27 is the hero we don't deserve.

It's in the Rio Grand Valley which is a highly impoverished area. Very low cost of living and the opportunity to teach a very under-served population.  2) Is it good place to live with a family? I have 2-year old son and new born. 3) I would look into what Texas is doing to K-12 education first. 4) The cost of living in Laredo is not low..., lower than Austin, yes, but compared to many other places in the state/country it's about the same. Most outsiders don't care for it, which is why there is a lot of turnover in the faculty at this university.  5) Median home price is $215k, about half the average for the US. Definitely low cost of housing. 6) Grew up in the area and long time Laredo resident. That median price is not a fair representation of the reality of housing in Laredo. Not willing to pursue the argument further than that, take it for what it is and apply to the job if you are interested. 7) I backed out of an interview for a position there previously because I had an unofficial job offer elsewhere and the faculty I interacted with were somewhat hostile/unprepared and the position reeked of desperation after multiple failed searches and subsequent failed searches in the years that followed. 8) @7, can you explain what you mean by ""unprepared""? I am also curious to hear if this was within the Entomology department or if it was elsewhere at A&M? 9) @8 By the way, this position is at Texas A&M International University not the department of Entomology at Texas A&M. 10) Be aware that Laredo is fully within border patrol territory. Anywhere within 100 miles of the border a lot of US constitutional rights officially don't apply. There are permanent checkpoints and a heavy BP presence. 11) I visited for an interview at the Bio Dept. Laredo gave me a sense of something between suburbia and boomtown.

Does this mean someone needs to be BIPOC to apply? 2) Yes but a woman or LGTBQ also has a shot - EDI is baked in to the Tier 2 CRCs. 3) I feel racialized after reading the +1 4) Godspeed BIPOC applicants! (5) I would check with the search committee because the federal program restricting Tier 2 CRCs to DEI candidates has not been applicable for several years. 2) ""all institutions that accept agency funding must make concerted efforts to meet their equity and diversity targets and provide a supportive and inclusive workplace. This supports the goals of equity, diversity and inclusion within the CRCP and the broader Canadian research enterprise."" https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/program-programme/equity-equite/index-eng.aspx 6) so basically no white guys? 7) yes, so basically no white guys 8) Seems like disabled white guys are a maybe. Also, it looks like their ability to restrict applicants to underrepresented people is contingent on the university not having met equity targets 9) given the extensive of the application, it would be good if the SC could confirm if only BIPOC applicants will be considered or if women, LGBTQ, disabled applicants would also be considered. 2) this is serious stuff - another Candian university lost their CRC2 funding and entirely cancelled a search/pulled a position and hired no one because their short list wasn't diverse enough. Just a few years ago. 6) @2 that's crazy... and while I'm a white guy who definitely would have wanted to apply for this job, I get it. Frustrating but I get it. 10) honesty I feel pretty discouraged when I see positions like this. Not because of the position, but the comments... 11) what about white guys that identify as two-sprit or non-sexual?  2) @ 10 very easy to say until it swings back against you. Discrimination is either ok or it is not ok. While this is going on, the Canadian government has determined that ""woman"" is no longer a equity-seeking or desrving group (b/c the public service is majority female now). i know more than a few white women who  loved tweeting about EDI stuff who were outraged they were denied jobs because of that.  https://universityaffairs.ca/news/parliament-reviews-edi-for-research-grants/ 12) I managed to confirm with the SC that the position is specifically for racialised applicants due to a short fall in this diversity category. 13) Will white transgender and/or non-binary people be considered for this position?  14) FYI: https://universityaffairs.ca/news/alberta-panel-recommends-new-funding-framework-dropping-edi/ Sorry @ 13, those groups aren't diverse enough to merit EDI considerations anymore. 15) categories other than ""racialized"" will be triaged by human resources. I work at U Lethbridge and that is what happens across the board with job advertisements like this. So other under-represented groups are unlikely to be seen, never mind considered by the search committee. Also our salaries and the town is not the most welcoming of places to live. A job is a job, but don't say that you weren't warned. 16) Can someone please confirm that Tier 2 Chair is equivalent to Assistant Professor? I am a postdoc, and confused whether I am eligible or not. It sounds to me more like a department chair position. 17) @ 16 it's a research chair (research-intensive professorship) not a department chair. CRC2s are the earlier career category of CRCs but they can be hired at the Assistant or Associate level depending on the department's desires and the experience level of the candidate. - thanks!

Very helpful to know. 5) saw a post on bsky saying they want a plant pathology person for this position 6) No. SC member here again. The plant pathology search is a *different* position. This search is for an organismal biologist, broadly defined. (Also, the other search is for a ""Plant Molecular Biologist"" not specifically pathology) 7)@SC language around references is a bit confusing so just to confirm you want us to put the info of our  letter writers both in the cover letter and the  respective section on the application?

I don't think many people would consider UNC Chapel Hill (one of the best public universities in the US) a ""starter job"" ... 16) Here the review date says 11/3 but the online job ad says it closes 11/10. Can anyone provide insight on this? 17) SC member here: we will begin to review the applications on 11/3; the electronic system will continue to accept applications through the 10th. Also, I very much agree that this isn't a 'starter job' - I moved here from another position and plan to stay! 18) Yes, that is a crazy uninformed take, if intentional. Unless getting poached up the road by Duke or by an Ivy or UC school, nobody is leaving Chapel Hill. 19) Can people who think this is a starter job please not apply. UNC is literally my dream school, and I would really like less competition.

OP: @1) Let me see what I'm allowed to say on this... I'm not sure tbh. @4) Yes, we are open to broader interpretations of ""Wildlife/Conservation Genetics""; and @5) Yes, the decision for this was mostly to cut down on the number of AI applications we get.. We just want to know you're a real person serious about applying for this position. We are happy to receive letters after initial screening if you're a serious candidate. 6) This probably demonstrates my naivete but im surprised that there are many AI TT applicants 7) curious if anyone has any thoughts about the culture at Weber State. particularly religious/LDS? what about DEI efforts in particularly those promoting queer community? are the faculty members (and people reviewing the application) likely to be LDS? OP @7) Ogden is located ~40 min north of SLC, with several faculty members in the department commuting from the city daily. In my experience neither city is particularly religious relative to the surrounding areas, but if you ask a different person with a different community you may get a different response. I can only speak for myself but I am not religious, and your religious beliefs will not be limiting in any way during the application process. We value diverse thoughts and humans, but as of recently we're not allowed to use certain language in our call for applications. I asked a colleague for input as well and their response is the following: ""I think it is fair and accurate to say there are places in the country that are a lot better with The DEI stuff and places that are worse.  The same would hold true with religion.  Typically university campuses have been islands that can buffer against these things in the more conservative states but unfortunately lately that has not been as true.  Fingers-crossed that the pendulum swings back soon."" @1) All salaries for Weber State professors in the state of Utah are publically available at https://transparent.utah.gov/ 8) any updates? 9) none on my end 10) zoon interview invitation (Dec 2) x3 11) on-campus interview invitation (Dec 20) x2","3","Match, exact","Weber State University","UT",230782,"Ogden","Master's Colleges & Universities: Larger Programs","Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence","Postbaccalaureate: Other-dominant, with Arts & Sciences","Four-year, medium full-time, inclusive, higher transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily nonresidential","Classified","Rocky Mountains CO ID MT UT WY","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Small","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","Yes",2678,2603,333,0,0,0,5614,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,52,281,760,1843,873,1837,29644,36761,29596,18152.666667,28685,911,10808,5856,1234,10787,389,522,2668,709,628,483,NA,NA,24,51,NA,1807,0.321874,68,15,11,0.161765,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,7,0,1001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How do labs count? Would it be common for some of those to be multiple sections of the same course? It does seem like an awful lot of teaching to still have a research expectation.6) 4 lecture courses or 2 lecture/lab courses a term 7) Doesnt' matter how supportive the faculty are, 5, if the school doesn't support the research. @1/4, Is ""no startup"" no startup, or low startup? 8) << question 7! Is it no support or start up funding at all? Do multiple sections of the same course count or is it four seperate lecture courses or two seperate lab courses each with multiple sections? Also it says review date is November 10th on the posting. 9) I am not on the SC but am a newish fac member. You can teach multiple sections and that still counts as contact hours (first semester was easy, all lower labs with all prep done). I applied for the $5000 internal grants every year, and had students apply for $1000 student grants. All equipment I needed was here.

Does this mean a) ABD will not be considered if not awarded by hire date, or b) ABD wil not be considered if not awarded by application review date? 2) For us mortals, what is ABD? 3) ABD = ""All but dissertation"", which refers to advanced grad students who just need to finish their dissertation/defense to earn the PhD 3) Ad says postdoc required along with ABD not considered. This means a degree by hire date still would not meet qualifications. 4) I thought ABD was ""All but DEGREE"", meaning the dissertation had been defended and the candidate is just awaiting the official awarding of the degree. ""All but degree"" and ""All but dissertation"" are two VERY different things. 4) @2, I was also under the impression this was the meaning (semantics maybe), @ 3, I don't think that's strictly correct. One could walk this December and have a post-doc lined up for Spring to get 8 months of post-doc experience before the hire date and meet all the requirements before that date but not the application deadline date. OR, they could defend this January, get hired as a ""post-doc"" and walk in May (stranger things have happened). Sounds like an unlikely scenario, but I happen to know someone in this exact situation. 5) What is the teaching load? 6) Nah ABD definitely refers to the actual work of the dissertation/defense, not the awarding of the degree (although that is relevant to your employer as well). Defending and submitting the dissertation is the final requirement-- everything else is just waiting on the academic calendar. Actually, I think it means both :) because you are definitely ABD until your degree is posted. 7) 6 is right and it isn't uncommon for people to be ABD for 3+ years. 8) Back to 1's original question, you are unlikely to meet the minimum qualifications they have set out for the job. If they don't have enough applicants, the search may fail instead of you having a shot. I wouldn't put effort behind this one. 9) emailed chair and can confirm that PhD completed with postdoc experience by application date of Nov. 1st to be considered (as stated in the minimum qualifications). 10) @1, I can't tell if some folks are being passive aggressive here but it's a reasonable question to ask, especially when MANY R1 institutions don't limit their applicant pool like this, at least not this explicitly, and many times the minimum qualifications are required by the time of appointment... looks like you have your answer. 11) Is there a way to move to this to a discussion. Most of this is not relevant to the ad now that we are clear on desired qualifications. I'm more interested in teaching load and research expectations. Looks like it is 21k students! 12) Funnily enough this isn't the language we agreed on in our department meeting. Should have said quantitative biologist. 13) @12 does that mean y'all are looking for a bioinformatician or is quantitaive ecology in the scope of the search? 14) Based on my reading of the ad, I don't think bioinformatics would be considered. Hopefully, @12 could provide an answer as I'm on the fence about this one. x2 15) any updates? 16) Nothing so far 3x 17) Still no news? 18) Request from search committee to share application with the rest of the department (12/2) x2 @18 Sorry, I didn't understand that correctly; did the search committee request other members of the department to see/check the applications? 18 again) Yes, it was an email from the search committee asking for permission to share application materials with the rest of the department (not sure specifics of why they are sharing).

Seems like a cool place to do wetland/aquatic work. 2) Worth noting ""We especially encourage candidates with expertise in fish and fisheries ecology."" 3) @1 I think it's one of the best aquatic ecology departments in the world. It will be hyper competitive. x3 4) I interviewed in this dept. earlier this year and was very impressed with everything, definitely world renowned in limnology as well. 5) @1 it's only the birthplace of limnology in north america. CFL is an incredible group, very collaborative. wish I did fish. madison is also amazing... 6) Is it worth the energy for folks who are non-fish aquatic researchers to apply? 7) I'm not sure anyone but the search committee can speak to that (and they won't). However, I know a fisheries researcher is leaving and I suspect this is intended to replace them. Assuming that's true, the odds for non-fish folks might be slim. But that's largely speculation. 8) will remain anon but I am currently employed at the center for limnology, I can confirm it is an incredible place to work with a great collaborative atmosphere and wonderful scientists.We are a famliy for sure and having the NTL LTER collaboration is awesome. They will definitely be  looking for a fish-centric researcher. 9) I did my PhD at this institution in a different department - but this department had a great reputation campus-wide.  10) I'm the ""fisheries researcher [who] is leaving"" mentioned by 7 and I can also confirm that this is an amazing place to work - family/geography pulled me away - nothing that should concern applicants. @10) Can you confirm if they will only evaluate applications that are fish-focused or if there 11) Not sure how your question would have ended, but as #10 is leaving the institution I doubt they can confirm anything about the search. Heck, I’ve never even felt comfortable making guarantees as to the future actions of the search committees on which I’ve served. Faculty are unpredictable, especially in groups. If you’re interested in the position and think you can put together an app that answers the posting (or even comes close) then you should go ahead and apply! 12) genuine question, originally the posting had some formating issues where CV and research statement were bunched up and had a ""(2 page maximum)"" line after them much like the teaching/mentoring does currently, but I see that neither of these have page limits attached, is anyone abiding by the previous for their research statement? 13) Has anyone heard anything??? 14) No, but it has only been 10 days since applications closed. It will take some time for the search committee to work through a likely robust candidate pool. 15) Adding to #14's comment, many of those days fell across a US holiday. I think it is likely that zoom interview invitations will go out before the Christmas holiday but also wouldn't be completely surprised if they waited until early January for that. Big searches like this tend to progress slowly and the US holiday season doesn't help with that. 16) also, was on a search with similar timeline ~2-3 years ago elsewhere as a grad student, interview invites for that search werent sent out until in Jan but we didn't bother with any Zoom and went straight to in-person with that. 17) any news? 18) Letters requested 12/10. 19) So folks without letter requests are SOL?? 20) That's usually how it pans out 21) @19 they are definitely missing out on some terrific candidates, consider yourself in good company 22) any updates? Has zoom happened already? 23) I hope not! Crossing my fingers for those of us still in the game. 24) it's a little odd to hear nothing since letter request - I'm hoping too that we are still in the game 25）I am in UW-Madison and I know the campus talks for candidates have been scheduled. 26) Well, that sucks.

Looking for an ecologist with a strong statistical background (research and teaching). Happy to answer questions. 1) looks like teaching load is 3-3 2) I am interested in applying to this position, but is soil ecology going to be considered as a relevant field?  3) I was trying to find info on the ""Department of Natural and Applied Sciences"" named in the job ad but... apparently that department doesn't exist? It might have been renamed, or absorbed? Heading to uwgb.edu/nas redirects to the College of Science, Engineering, and Technology. Can SC weigh in? 4) SC here. SC here. @1 teaching load is currently 3-4, but that includes labs. The WI legislature is planning on moving everyone to 4-4, but the plan is to better account for research student supervision and so teaching load might actually decrease. @2 we have several faculty who study elements of soil and water quality, given the agg/industry history of the region – so sure! @3 like many places our organization can be a little confusing. The College (CSET) houses three departments: engineering, human biology, natural sciences. The Department of Natural Sciences is a functional unit, but subdivided into bio, chem, phys, envi-sci, geo – which correspond to the majors and MS programs. The website is student-facing and so it is organized by college, and then by programs – with faculty listed in the program sections. Weird, but functionally it works. 5) Is there a startup offered with this position? If so, what could be expected? I am not asking for a specific amount, but rather what the startup would typically cover. 6) @5 Yes, but probably an order of magnitude lower than an R1 startup. Mine covered a lot of field equipment, but not big-ticket items or staff salary. There is internal money for big items, and they tend to be purchased for the entire dept (pool vehicles, lab instruments, boats, manufacturing equip. etc). Research expectations for tenure reflect this. 7) Is it reasonable to expect starting salaries here to be similar to UW-Stevens Point and other regional UW schools? For example, UW-SP is ~$59,000/year staring, also do opportunities for summer teaching exist? 8) @7 same ballpark (maybe a little more), but I don't know the specifics. Luckily, in GB you can still buy a house for 200k. Yes, there are summer teaching opportunities. 9) Has anyone heard any updates on this one? 10) Not yet x6 (11/18) 11) We are still reviewing the applications and will schedule phone interviews very soon.

What does this even mean? 3) Firing tenured professors for not aligning with the president's political views. Sad times. 3) Salary Expectations?? 4) to #3, it's a public university so you can see the salaries current professors make in a simple search on google. 5) It is a difficult institution that often is in lock-step with the TX state gov't 6) Somewhat suprised to see an opening for Evolution, wonder if there will be any issues with teaching that? 7) Current faculty here at A&M. Was just teaching evolution last week with no issues. 8) don't come to Texas right now.. just don't. Even if evolution has no issues currently we are all scared. We have students with cellphones actively trying to catch profs in ""gotchas"" and get them fired. We have multiple faculty under investigation for social media posts or fired for comments at conferences… it's horrific 8) Not sure it really matters, but I think the instructor that was fired was not tenured, or even tenure track 9) I am a recently tenured professor in the dept that is hiring. Yes Texas can be a challenging place to come in the current political climate - that is the clear downside. However, we have many upsides too. This is one of the largest biology departments in the country ~200 grad students ~45 research active faculty, we are building a new biology building/coimplex. We have had zero issues with academic freedom in the sciences. We also have a large and diverse EEB community in our interdepartmental program with about 50 PhD students. School is large enough that resources abound and you can do the science you want and build the lab that you want. I encourage people to apply and then make a decision if you get an interview. We are a fun department that is tight knit and has had a lot of success in the last several years. With regard to comment 8 this is not the landscape in the biology department at all. 10) regarding application documents, are we supposed to have a separate service document? The way it is listed could either be determined as a separate document, or one embedded into the teaching document ""short cover letter (one page), curriculum vitae, personal statement to include philosophy and plans for research (max three pages), teaching (max two pages), and service, and contact information for three references"" 11) good point 10, the service statment can be included in teaching sorry for the confusing way that we put that sentence. 12) Is it okay to apply after 10/01/25, since the due date is 11/15/25? Is there any advantage to applying early? 13) @12 couldn't hurt to apply after 10/01, especially if you have a preprint, certification, or something else extra to add since that date 14)Any updates? 15) nothing here x3 16) Rejected 10/31 (x2) @16 did you receive any email? 16) Yes, I received an email. So if you haven't gotten one, it's a good sign! 17) On campus interview invite, 11/2 x2 18) Do you mind sharing what your subject area is? 19) 17 again: Behavioral & Molecular Ecology/Organismal Resilience 20) They do campus invites without zoom? Didn't realize anyone did that! 21) Also haven't heard anything x5 22) The other Texas A&M job search below apparently mentioned they won't be considering candidates who need visa sponsorships. Is it the same with this search? 23) Got an email of rejection on 11/5 24) reference letter requested on 11/7 x5 25) @24 (or others) were letters requested through interfolio? I haven't heard anyhting at all yet x 2 26) 24 again, my letter writer let me know 27) I just submitted my application on 11/7 because I thought they would follow their application deadline of 11/15, do anyone think I should be hopeful my application would be reviewed? 28) Got a rejection letter from the Microbiology search on 11/18 29) Is there anyone else here who has still not heard anything? 30) I haven't heard anything (Nov 21) x5 31) @30 unsure if you mean post letter request, but they requested my letters but haven't heard anything since x3 32) on-site has been completed. 33) @32 for all positions? 34) can you kindly specify what your area is if you post an update because I think these are moving at different times 35) all of the positions (evolution, micro, clocks) are being managed by the same search committee. 36) I heard from my letter writers that I am shortlisted but I didn't receive anything after that.

I was offered $56k at my suny but managed to get them up to $58k lol 3) This kind of thing is what the venting page is for, so that people can vent without annoying the rest of us. 4) Would they consider a hire at the Associate level? 5) @3, this all seems highly relevant for anyone thinking of applying for this job. Scroll past if you don't want to read it. x3 6) @3 very difficult to compare across SUNY campuses because there is a ton of salary heterogeneity (based on research profile and location, the R1 campuses regularly pay 100+ for new assistant profs). Minimum likely means the lower end of the salary band approved internally for the job (I agree that it's likely not to go way higher, but this is worth asking the search chair about down the road rather than making assumptions) 7) Based on the current salaries of their biology assistant professors (https://openpayrolls.com/university-college/suny-plattsburgh), I would not bet on getting a salary offer much higher than that advertised. Also worth noting that the salary increases on promotion are not large. 8) cost of living for a family of 4 in platsburgh is 50K, also a house is under 250K   9)  "" teaching undergraduate courses in introductory biology (and associated lab), genetics (and associated lab), cell biology, communicating biology, and courses in the applicant’s areas of expertise."" 10) For those saying the salary discussions should be on the venting page, it's very helpful for me to see them here, salary/cost of living can be immediately disqualifying for some of us with dependents/from low income backgrounds. x3 10) I agree salary should be listed, but your mileage may vary on what ""liveable"" means, because everyone here has a different idea of what that should be. One person's ""you can't live on that"" is another's ""I can make that work"". You also don't know what incentives might exist for housing (some schools help faculty with downpayments or have on-campus housing). Utlimately, I think the salary should be shared and people have to do the extra work to see if that pay meets their needs. 11) any updates? x3 12) Phone interview invite 10/7 13) Campus interview invite 10/16 x2 14) Does anyone know if they extended an offer? 15) Yes, they did.

This is not a TT position but the previous person in the role retired after 25 years in it. The vision is long term (not a postdoc). 1) European here. Whats life around campus? looks like its in the middle of f nowhere suburbia, with few things else to do than a long drive to Manhattan or Brooklyn? 2) If you think this is the middle of nowhere suburbia you should see the rest of the US! But yeah, deep into Long Island is not a place where everyone is desperate to move to. 3) Definitely suburban, but when you start getting this far out in long island the nature/beaches are also very pretty. A decent number of faculty and many students live in the city (a big chunk of students from queens), but it is a trek. There is a commuter rail that runs to campus but it would be a very long commute. Some people also live in connecticuit and take the ferry as well. @1 4) I've visited long island many times and my partner is from there. If you've never been to the NYC area it is difficult to imagine the size and scale of urbanization and the patterns driven by the development of parkways initially and interstate systems thereafter. It is the original suburban landscape. Stonybrook is on the northshore where I have spent less time and has its own extremely complex geographical history with landowners. Nevertheless, I think you would be deeply impressed by this area. I have been all over the US and there is nothing else like it here. That being said, due to this complex history the traffic is horrible and the rail system has gone through difficult times due to the prioritization of transportation by cars over 1/2 a century. People who live there have adapted to this lifestyle in different ways. 5) Yes, but there are 8 million people on Long Island. It really is not the middle of nowhere. If you want to think about it in European terms it has more people than half the countries in the EU. 6) I did my PhD there, it is honestly a nice area to live relatively speaking, lots of folks communiting into and out of the city, but housing is expensive. 7) Also the area around stony brook is known for having very good schools, but also high taxes 8) life on that part of Long Island can be pretty great - good schools, and more cultural resources than most highly suburban areas across the US - but yeah you are not really close to NYC and I doubt many people that live there work in NY or vice versa. I lived in NY many years and some of my friends commuted to SB - it's 90 minutes to central Queens which is not exactly downtown Manhattan. It's also one of the worst traffic areas in the world (there's only two highways that run east-west). All that is to say if you work at SB you will probably be a Long Islander and not a New Yorker, but there's nothing wrong with that... 8) I work in this department and it's very collegial, good culture. I commute from CTby Ferry which is 3 hrs door to door. My PI commutes from NYC, nearly as long. However, you can read and do other light work while commuting because public transit is good. 9) Three hours?! im so sorry @8... I can barely force myself to commute 10 min 10) for what it's worth, there is housing right next to campus with a <10 min commute, but if you want to live in NYC and have a 10 min commute that's not possible clearlys. 11) any update? 12) Husband got a Zoom interview invite 11/7 13) Second round interview invite 11/23 14) In person interview invite 12/8","1","Match, exact","Stony Brook University","NY",196097,"Stony Brook","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, higher transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Not Classified","Mid East DE DC MD NJ NY PA","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Suburb Large","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,5064,2043,335,204,0,7646,260203,3267,365,1670,23,68,219,25,310,25,851,1396,3334,1730,0,0,26814,34115,26782,23584,18010,8772,16584,1378,2,46,5399,3373,3306,16,1441,155,NA,NA,22,51,NA,1515,0.198143,52,128,34,0.653846,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,20,17,10474,2937,655,600,630,1230,26,25,25.18235,37083,18138,0.489119,3

It has also unwound its DEI policies, and considering how broadly the Trump admin's mass grant freezes have interpreted that, I wouldn't consider applying here if your work touches on even *biological* diversity. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/columbia-university-funding-trump-demands https://www.npr.org/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5479240/columbia-trump-administration-settlement-details 4) Thanks, as an international I will not apply for this. x3 5) More importantly, Columbia (school) is presently being sued by Columbia (sportswear company) for violating their trademark agreement. The school is not to use ""Columbia"" on its own but they started selling merch with just that (previously they included, by agreement, the founding year or ""University""). 6) How is that more important @5? x4 fr! 7) this is all conjecture and gossip, Columbia will be fine x2 8) Currently at Columbia here. It is not fun to see one's institution in the political spotlight and many people are anxious. But wrt actual tangible effects day to day for most people, I do not think it is much different than other R1 institutions heavily dependent on federal funding. It helps that Columbia is a comparatively wealthy school so funds can be moved around. E.g. the university is putting up a substantial amount of bridge funding internally as a direct result of the federal cuts. If you are extremely outspoken politically on social media I would perhaps not recommend applying. And if you are generally not applying to US schools rn that is understandable. But IMO it's not as bad on the ground as you might gather from the media. 9) Thank you @8 for the actually helpful perspective.x5 5) @ 6 because they willfully reneged on a legal agreement and will only lose that case.

That usually means if they make a hire they will be able to fund it and if they don't make a hire, the university takes the funds back. 14) Anyone having issues with submitting the application on interfolio? 15) Have seen a post from a Department member that priority is given to applications received before Oct 20  16) @14, I had an issue with it saying my application was incomplete even though all of the required files were uploaded.

It is essential that people learn the language of the country/provice they move to. 2) are candidates who are not already French fluent even considered for these positions? Just curious how that weighs into the selection of a candidate 3) I know an American who worked here and was hired with no French language skills. So it's not impossible. He did indicate that it was pretty hard to teach while just learning French. 4) @2 A good proportion of the latest hires in that department were not francophones.  5) Correct, there are a fair portion of non-Francophones across this, and many other, francophone universities in Québec.what pisses people (francophones) off and what is so excruciatingly hard to understand in this online community is the constant talk of how new TT hires can get away by just continuing speaking *1* language, English, and with as little effort as possible get a TT position in North America without learning the official language. It baffles me daily that people move to our Province without learning French. Imagine moving to Toronto, NYC or San Francisco and insisting on how much it is feasible to live, work, teach, drive a lab while being minimally able to communicate in English while being fluent in French. No way. People: adapt, learn the langauge, speak it and respect that the only, repeast only, offical language in Québec is French. It is exceedingly difficult to do anything Government or Public Administration without being pretty fluent. 6) Gonna push back on 5 here - I'm a historic anglo from QC and the way the government has gone about the language issue from the 60's has done nothing but harm the province. Montreal, in particular, is historically just as much Irish/English as it was French (probably even more so) and the main reason Mtl doesn't have bilingual status is because of fear of reprisals from the province. That said, grad students can write their theses in English at the French schools, and in French at the English schools, but this is all silly as even the most separatist Franco profs do their publishing in English. Bilingualism is always an asset, but using the stick instead of the carrot and further pushing racist/ethnic/linguistic divisions really doesn't help the French language. 7) Please everyone, this is not the place to discuss the political aspect of speaking French vs English in Québec/Montréal. The Université de Montréal is a French-speaking University, and people applying will be expected to teach in French within a few months/years of hiring. They may also have to supervise students that only speak French, so they must be serious about their will to learn the language. Montréal is mostly bilingual, so applicant speaking only in English should be able to live properly when they arrive, and shouldn’t stress about not speaking French on arrival. That’s all applicants need to know. 8) As a Canadian (not Quebecois) with a foreign spouse I am just noticing family sponsorship is closed in Quebec until summer 2026 and they have a limit on the number of applications. Something you may need to navigate if you intend to immigrate to Quebec from outside of Canada. 9) any updates on this one? (11/17) 10) mine still just says application submitted (11/19) 11) In person interviews for this position are starting next week. 12) @11 any more details on this? does that mean for those that still just have no update should assume rejection?

But the teaching load for tenure-track faculty in both the School of Earth, Ocean, and Environment and Department of Biological Sciences is 1 class per semester. Having tenure-track faculty based out at the coastal lab is a relatively new thing, so the need to travel to-and-from Columbia is still up in the air and would need to be figured out during negotiations and in the coming year. 8) This job, and others posted this cycle by USC, auto-requests letters of recommendation from listed references. Posting incorrectly states only those selected for virtual interviews will have their references contacted. Beware! 9) Anyone hear anything yet? 10) Nothing here (11/21) 11) Rejection email received 11/25 (no interview) x3 12) No rejection here but also no interview (yet?) 11/26 13) @ 12 same x2 14) invited for Zoom interview 12/1 x3 15) campus invite","11","Match, by alias","University of South Carolina-Columbia","SC",218663,"Columbia","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Professions plus arts & sciences, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, higher transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Midsize","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",4,6940,1604,438,492,0,9478,187909,31555,148,1443,28,44,157,209,229,209,282,1814,2330,4610,0,4,35364,38526,35470,33026,27271,8199,26070,983,104,114,5630,2569,5734,8,1489,83,NA,NA,25,52,NA,2708,0.285714,65,146,45,0.692308,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,22,18,9001,3522,2153,580,560,1140,25,23,23.758767,34957,23894,0.683525,3

The university has a great french immersion program including private tutors to help with the task and non-francophones get 1 year free of teaching to dedicate to learning the language. 3) Is there a French version of the job offer / should people with proficient French language write up their application in French or is English better (considering I'm only finding the English version of the job offer)? 4) the french version is here https://fas.umontreal.ca/public/FAS/fas/Documents/1-faculte_services/poste-professeur/2025/529883_FAS.pdf, but it should (I think) be fine to apply in english—I intend to do that as I have not updated my french CV in 10 years. PS, hoping this is my chance to return to my hometown. 5) you could add a sentence at the end of your first cover letter paragraph in french? Or at the end of the cover letter? I would definately put that you speak french in the cover letter very very clearly 6) would this be typical for other Canadian postings where the cover letter should also include clear mention of citizenship? 7) Same question as 6, I'm confused with ""responsible citizens"" does that mean only Canadain citizen are eligible? If not, is there any visa support. x2 8) Its not restricted to Canadian citizens and yes the university offers a lot of support to foreign hires including visas 9) I cannot see the deadline to apply on the ad; is it 10/19/2025 as it appears on the spreadsheet? [link updated, which includes deadline -AP] 6) Do we know if letters are required up front? 10) I was about to submit my application but the portal says the position is no longer available. Is this true? 11) Same deal here, job not available. It seems ot me like an issue with the portal (probably submission Sunday 19 defaults to Friday 17 by the end of the day). I will contact the chair directly so they're aware of the issue and strike myself out of the search in doing so :D.

I assume you were invited on 27th, not 28th? (According to the ""last update"" column you wrote on Nov 27th). Anyone else here received an invite? 20) Congrats to those invited.

Both basic and applied approaches, including model systems, are welcome."" 2) dream university for me, but alas not a plant biologist :( 3) dream university location for sure. $78 - $80K salary though is not a dream.  2 again) will be more than happy with 70k or less if I get to live in Montana for the rest of my life. 4) I hear you. I'm going to apply but in Bozeman the ""average home prices well over $800,000 and rent typically between $1,900–$2,800"", make it like I'll probably have to have a side hustle too.  5) II wonder if general plant ecology too far afield for this one? 5) Current MSU faculty (not on SC); I would still view base salaries (and everything) as negotiable in this case, startups (historically) come with summer salary support to get you going, and 800K is more applicable to standalone 2K square foot homes. The market has cooled, and there are a variety of housing types probably starting in the ~400Ks, but I can't argue that the imbalance of salary to housing costs is the #1 problem at MSU (and bozeman) and I've been dissapointed at the shoulder shrugs from admin about it. 6) Just finished graduate degree at MSU-- great location for sure, but I cannot stress enough that you should visit and make sure you're willing to live in an expensive mountain town with cold winters. It was great for me, but seriously consider the housing market and lifestyle. 7) I love cold winters. @6 how was the grad student support? It sounds like you survived--congrats, but if they pay starting professors a postdoc salary how do they pay grad students and postdocs there? Looking up the salaries at MSU is interesting, some decent salaries across departments, but the assistant profs in this department look rediculously low ($50K?), if accurate.  8) You can expect probably at least 80K base, 50K is wrong or outdated, especially for this type of position. Summers are short and glorious but activity-wise it really is a winter (and therefore ski) dominant town. For student support, you have to be scrappy at MSU and therefore be able to acquire internal and external funding and do so creatively. GTA support is nowhere near a UGA or Madison; Montana is a poor state, but that also opens up less-competitve EPSCoR pools of $. 9) MSU is not hiring researchers they need to sponsor visa/green card, I know from someone that recently applied for a position there. 10) Hi this is 6 responding-- the department I was in was great and I lived in on campus housing. I was able to TA every semester that I wanted and was a GRA every semester also. I had no financial support from my family or side jobs and I had enough for rent and fun stuff-- wasn't gonna travel to Disney and buy designer clothes but I could maintain my hobbies and eat and have a car. The LRES department at MSU pays grad students better than a lot of the departments on campus because we publish a lot--I've heard department of Ecology isn't as good but is still better than others. Grad student housing rent just went up by something stupid like 30% though and they're not allowed to increase grad student pay by more than 5% (this is if memory serves, I might be wrong). Grad student support was great, love the GSO, and the profs (mostly). Frankly I preferred it to the bigger R1 I'm at now for a postdoc where everyone is cold and hostile and socially awkward. 11) Recently hired MSU faculty (not in this department): my experience was that the academic year salary was not negotiable outside of the published salary band for the position I applied to. Other components were negotiable, but salary really was not. And yes Bozeman is expensive especially relative to the university salary. Grad student support varies by department (for example, how GTA vs GRAs work), and is a good thing to ask about during on campus interview IMO. 12) what is it like being a queer in Boseman and latina?

We are particularly interested in applicants with expertise and research interests animal-inspired robotics, social and collective behaviour, machine-learning and neuronal networks, invertebrate model systems, sensory ecology but candidates with excellence in any area of animal behaviour will be considered 2) I guess people normally applying for Asst Prof positions do no have a chance? 3) Hard to tell. As someone who is new to the UK salary brackets, how managable is the advertised salary range (55-75k) for living in Oxford? x3 4) This comes with a tutorial fellowship, which includes substantial housing allowance/no interest load. But the tutorial fellowship will also requre a lot of teaching 5) @2 Oxford don't recruit at Asst. Prof. level, so don't let that put you off - this is currently the 'entry-level' for permanent positions. People interviewed for Oxford Biology Assoc. Prof jobs recently have ranged from only a few years postdoc experience through to very established names. @3 More than liveable - this is linked to one of the richest colleges and comes with very substantial perks (including choice of free central accommodation or £20k). @4 College small-group teaching stint is nominally 6 weighted contact hours per week in term. Even with associated admin, this can be done in under a day a week in term. Your mileage will vary if this is a lot (it is in addition to 'departmental' teaching) but terms are short! 5) What application materials are required? I don't see any specifics for research statement, teaching philosophy, service statement, etc... x2 6) also curious about the expectations for the document we're meant to upload showing how we meet the criteria (e.g., length, formating?). 6) I don't understand what we're supposed to upload for this application.

It contains more detail on what they want in the supporting statement 8) what's with the extended deadline? the other position delivered fast rejections! is this a UK thing? 9) The extended deadline was due to a disagreement between the college and department on various aspects of the advert (HR cockup). Nothing nefarious! 10) Any updates? 11) Rejection email received 11/19 (x2) 12) Oof sorry about that - anyone receive invitations? Or can search committee members speak to when those will go out? Did anyone get an invitation (12/1)? 12) Have not heard anything yet! (x4) 13) Anyone gotten any updates? (x2) 14) nothing yet 12/16 (x4) Any updates 01/07? No updates here, Jan 18th (x3). 15) i supsect there was something in the job advert that if nothing is heard after n amount of weeks then can assume haven't been selected, but seems odd that #11 did receive a rejection email.

Your primary duty will be teaching, mentoring, and advising the undergrads, and your research program may be able to accomodate a postdoc, should you get the money for one, but not a gradaute student of your own.

It looks like its a bit in the middle of nowhere. 3) Interviewed here for a postdoc, it felt like a small college town with extensive ROTC presence (saw tons of people in their military uniform on campus). You'll see tons of ranches 15 minutes outside of the town. Didn't end up choosing this place (chose Colorado instead). 4) Very isolated but the community is good, as long as you don't mind 2+ hour drives to the nearest city 5) @3 The Corps of Cadets is unlike any ROTC with more than half of them not actually in ROTC. Having done my PhD there, it's not a bad place but is a different feel from most colleges (though not faculty--those are pretty much the same everywhere). 6) @4, the Bryan-College Station metro has over 250,000 people. 7)@6, Out of which roughly 1/3 are affiliated with TAMU, and then you're 2.5 hrs away by car from any city, without many public transit options to get there.

That means that 13 days are automatically granted as ""vacation"", but you would accrue additional vacation days as well.  So it's not only 13 days off the whole year, but 13 + some amount.

What do they mean by ""pastoral care""? 2) I am not from the SC, but I've seen this phrase used elsewhere in other institutions. I think it basically means that if you notice a student in distress, you have an idea of how to support them and can at least try helping them get through it 3) British lecturer here (but not at this uni) - most undergraduates at UK unis will be assigned a 'pastoral tutor',  'personal tutor' or similarly-named person, usually an academic involved in their degree. Expectations will vary, but you usually meet each tutee once or twice per semester to make sure they're on track and generally happy in life. If they have problems that require special attention then you can direct them to counselling, finance teams, etc. You also write their reference for jobs/grad school, should they ask for one. Basically, it's about caring for students beyond reading lists, classes and examinations, and depending on their choice of classes you may never actually teach your tutees. Tutor training is usually given, to make sure you ask the right questions when you're concerned about someone. It isn't the biggest part of the job, but it's very important and very rewarding. 4) It's similar to being a ""faculty mentor"" with assigned undergrads (many US universities have this system). 5) Did anyone go to the open information session and was there anything useful mentioned at it? I was in another meeting that day and missed it sadly! x2 6) I was there. They will do a long-listing process to initially screen a larger group of potential candidates, which will need to give a short (12 min) online presentation between 17-28th Nov; those that are short-listed will told 'immediately' (not sure how immediate) and called back for a longer online interview (10 min presentation, 30 min structured interview) between 8-12th Dec. Expected to start by September 2026 but as early as April; campus location largely dictated by research area; internal PhD scholarships should be available to new recruits but not 100% guaranteed. They anticipate that they will announce the long-listed candidates by November 7th. 7) I'm confused, do they just want a CV and a cover letter or do they want full research/teaching/EDI statements to fit in the 4000 word boxes? 8) They ask for a teaching statement in the list of what to include in the CV but they don't mention DEI or research statements. They're less common for UK positions from what I've seen. In the information session they said they were interested to see how people filled in the text boxes but they didn't have a specific way they wanted them filled. Not sure if adding a research statement would be an asset or hindrance, though. 9) anyone knows when we can expect to hear about the long-listing selection? or has anyone already heard back from the SC? 10) In my experience UK searches are typically pretty good about informing all applicants about their status at each step. So if you haven't heard anything, I'm guessing no one has. x2 11) UK searches typically go quick ime. I would guess that interview invites are going out soon, if they haven't already 12) At the presentation they said they expected to send out invitations by November 7th.  It may be earlier than that, but I personally am not expecting to hear anything until then.10) Thanks for the info, 12! x2 13) Has anyone logged into the application system? When I do, it shows me having two applications for this job, one of which appeared a week or so after I applied. 14) Just checked. Same as 13. Strange! 15) I have another application started a week later also but mine is for the life sciences stream I applied for specifically. Was that the same for others? 16) It is now Nov 7, has anyone heard? 17) No news. x5 18) they are currently moving forward with interviews. rejection letters will go out when the search has concluded. 19) For a similar position last year, they sent rejection letters about a month after the review date (I had applied back then too). I guess they won't do it this time? 19) Looks like all applicants just got an email saying they will invite folks for interviews until the 14th 20) Did anyone else not receive that email just now? 21) Email says they had 550 applications 22) my understanding is that this was sent to all applicants, including those who were offered an interview, no? because they say next step will be for applicants invited to give a seminar. sounds to me like it's for the few ones who made it through the interview stage.  23) It sounds like they haven't actually sent out interview invites yet?  No one on here at least has gotten an interview invite? x4 24) I got that email and did not receive an interview invite yet so it seems like they sent it around widely x2 25) Zoom invite 11/13 x4 26) Does anyone have the ad saved that they would be willing to share since it's no longer posted? 27) found it here: https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/DOI465/assistant-associate-professors 28) which area/stream did you all apply to, who got zoom invites? 11/13 Zoom invite 29) @28 T&O + M&C 30) Anyone from the ecology stream? 31) @30 me! x2 32) post-Zoom rejection x4","11","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, the role focuses on the biochemical and molecular ecology of plants to understand how ecological dynamics drive plant adaptation, species interactions, and ecosystem function. 1) Yes, this position is a replacement for Dr. Jeeyon Jeong, who recently passed away. 2) Note from a member of the department: expertise in plant biology is desirable because that area is underrepresented in our department, but it is not a requirement of the position.  Please also note that this is a completely open search; rumors that this is a sham search for an internal candidate are false.  Interested applicants are encouraged to contact the department chair with any questions. @2) Thank you for the clarification, and appreciate your clear statement that the search is open and not intended for a pre-selected internal candidate, which should help close the door on such rumors. 3) Not liking the drift towards a world in which search committees are routinely expected to debunk baseless speculation about preferred internal candidates for US and Canadian jobs. A better norm would be to scold the people who start and spread those rumors, or for AP to delete all such rumors. We shouldn't be indulging conspiratorial thinking x2. @3 Did you read 1’s and 2’s responses first? #1 clearly stated that this position is a replacement for a plant biologist. #2, apparently from the department itself, confirmed that plant biology expertise is “desirable.” Yet nowhere in the official job description is plant biology listed as desired or preferred. That means only internal candidates would realistically know what the hiring committee is prioritizing, which creates an uneven playing field for external applicants. What does this tell you? 4) Honestly, the only conclusion I can draw from the nonsense in #3’s response is that #3 is very likely the internal candidate themselves, or at the very least someone with a vested interest in shutting down this discussion. x5 3) You've solved the great conspiracy. Well done. x2 6) I am concerned that some are treating these issues lightly, when in fact they raise very serious questions about fairness and transparency in academic hiring.Transparency requires that all applicants—internal or external—have access to the same criteria and expectations. When “desirable” qualifications are left unstated, it undermines the integrity of the process. Dismissive responses that frame these concerns as “conspiracy thinking” only reinforce the perception of bias. Rather than shutting down discussion, departments should take such concerns seriously, since accountability and openness are central to equitable hiring. We should keep our eyes on the outcome of this hire. If the result aligns with the unofficial criteria rather than the official posting, it will confirm the very inequities being raised here and should be flagged for closer scrutiny. 6) #3 here. Lol, I don't work at Amherst, never have. Not even a current job seeker. Looking forward to accusations that I'm an internal candidate who's lying to scare away external applicants. @3 I believe no one here is interested in confirming whether you are or aren’t the internal candidate, that’s irrelevant. What is relevant is why someone who claims not to be a job seeker is nonetheless monitoring and commenting repeatedly on a specific job posting, pushing the same dismissive line each time.. If you truly have no stake in this hire, then your repeated interventions look less like neutral observation and more like an attempt to dismiss legitimate concerns. 7) #3 again. There's your problem--you're assuming the comments you don't like are all from me. They're not. And the repeated baseless rumors that crop up on this sheet about sham searches intended for favored internal candidates are toxic paranoia, not ""legitimate concerns"". x2 8) Easy, dude. #3, what are you even saying? You’ve been repeating the same line over and over, nobody cares who you are. The issue is transparency in the hire. And if you’re not currently looking for jobs, as you’ve said, then why keep pushing so hard on this one posting? Dudes #1 and #2 already laid out the key facts, this is about fairness, not conspiracy. 9) #2 here: I apologize if my previous statement about plant biology expertise being ""desirable"" indicated any sort of hidden agenda in the search. We are a small department trying to cover the breadth of biology, so any area of expertise or model system that is not currently represented or underrepresented in our department would be considered desirable. 3) I hope you actually give that internal candidate a fighting chance. It is really demoralizing if they are a fantastic scientist and colleague but are nervous in the interview and as a result do not get selected. Been there done that. Good luck to whomever the internal candidate may be. And no I am not it but I am an internal candidate somewhere else and interviewing with people you share jokes with everyday is nerve-wracking. 11) @3 The issue here isn’t about whether an internal candidate “gets a fighting chance.” Internal candidates already benefit from familiarity, access, and visibility that external applicants simply don’t have. That’s not demoralizing—it’s an inherent advantage. What is demoralizing is when job postings appear tailored in timing or criteria to match the profile of one or two insiders, which discourages highly qualified external candidates from even applying. That undermines the spirit of an open and competitive search. Searches at institutions like Amherst College should be about finding the best possible candidate for students and the department’s future, not about managing interview nerves for someone who already had insider access. If the process is fair, then the strongest applicant—internal or external—should rise to the top. 3) Assuming that familiary is advantageous is a mistake. It actually can make it harder and we all know that regardless of how good you have been and are and will be as a scientist, a simple 1 or 2 day interview, or worse a 20 min zoom can negate all of that if your nervousness makes you make a little mistake. Being an internal candidate is actually pretty awful. Most people are good enough. It is not about who is the best. And in that sense internal candidate is actually the best for the employer because there is less training and other crap to take care of because of familiarity. The truth is most candidates that were short-listed will do just fine job so making an offer to the internal candidates makes the most sense. @3 That line of reasoning might feel valid from the inside like yourself, but it sidesteps the fundamental purpose of a national search: to ensure that faculty hires are based on merit, vision, and future promise—not familiarity or convenience. Yes, interviews are stressful. Yes, anyone—internal or external—can stumble. But the solution isn’t to lower the bar or reward proximity. It’s to make sure the process is equitable, robust, and transparent so that everyone, including those who’ve never had the chance to “share jokes in the hallway,” has a fair shot. ,And no, internal candidates are not “the best” for the employer just because they’re easier to onboard. That mindset reduces hiring to a logistical shortcut, not a strategic investment in academic excellence.

We're an integrative biology department with faculty who study everything from ecosystem ecology to stem cell biology. The ecology and evolution faculty (and other faculty) are collegial and enthustiastic. 2) It's a generally cordial department. Not as much socializing as other places (probably because most folks need to drive home after work), but the ecology faculty seemed pretty friendly when I was there. 3) I did my PhD in this department, really great faculty and supportive department with $$$, some higher ups have catholic conservative motivations that can interfere with good science/hiring/retention x2 4) Also worth mentioning that the cost of living in South Bend is very low, nice houses under 100K - even grad student stipends go a long way. 5) Any idea of what it's like being gay/in an openly and visually queer marriage at Notre Dame and South Bend in general? x2 6) ND has a LGBTQIA+ employee resource group called Spectrum for queer faculty and staff, which has been a good network for me at the university. I had no issues within the Biology Dept (I was staff), but feel free to reach out to Spectrum directly to ask for more conversations or perspectives. 7) I see that the job description states that ""successful candidates will engage with and benefit from UNDERC (...)"". Does this imply that they are only considering applicants who will be tailoring their research program to work in this NEON field station? 8) search co-chair again, engaging with UNDERC is definitely not a requirement, but I can see why the wording is confusing. Rather, we were trying to highlight UNDERC and other facilities as possible benefits of ND to scientists who can make logical use of them in their programs. 9) Are references immediately contacted? 10) References are not contacted immediately. We will contact references at the Zoom interview stage. 11) @10 Great, thank you for the information! 12) @SC members: any preference or recomemndation on # of pages for research statement: 2 pages or 3 pages? 13) @12 we have no preference. Take what you need to explain your program. 2or 3 pages is fine. 14) is deadline 10/15 or 10/27? highered vs interfolio say different things. 15) @14 Oct 27th is the final deadline, but we will start looking at applicarions on the 15th. 16) @3 LMFAO, they are far from supportive. I've known over 6 people pursuing PhD in Evolutionary Biology that left without their degrees within the last 8 years because of the faculty, three (NOW 4) of which were from the same lab. 17) Any updates? x8 18) I am a graduate from the PhD program - 3  people leaving from the same lab says more about the faculty member they were working with! Excellent school with $$$$! 16) @18 the fact the admins and upper level folks are fully aware of the person's rep and won't do anything and another prof had multiple formal allegations but retired ""early"" with full pension and honor intact and zero accountability. 19) Unfortunately 16, that pattern wouldn't be at all unique to this department. Basically some version of that story could be told everywhere I've ever spent time, the difference is just in how widely known the details are. (x2) 20) any updates on this search - has anybody had their references write letters already? 21) no, not here x15 22) 54 applicants via ecoevojobs is craazy - most of any job in the past two cycles on this board! 23) Any updates 11/18? x5 24 @22 I guess people aren't afraid of red states... 25) surely they have lots of applications to sift through but this is taking quite a bit longer to get to their Zoom interview stage than other apps i've been involved with 26) my guess is they are overwhelmed and have to rethink their process. anybody from SC here to clarify? 27) I had letters requested. Not sure when exactly but I think just this week. Request went to my writers not to me. 28) Letters requested yesterday (11/24). 29) Very cool to request letters from people the day before many of them take off for the holidays (in the States). 30) Letters requested (11/24) x5 30) Think some letter requests may be going out piecemeal, as some of my refs got requests and some did not. 31) anyone know what they mean by 'multiple' positions - are we talking 2 positions, 3, or more? How big is the cluster? 32) Wording is intentionally vague. 33) My guess is that the SC will interview around 15 to 20 people on Zoom, bring 6 to 9 to campus, and hire about 2 to 3 in the end. 34) Zoom invite 12/1 x4  35) Weird that they would start sending out zoom invites before the deadline for letters to be submitted, no? 36) I would assume they plan to use letters + zoom interviews to decide on campus invites and they want to get zooms done before holiday breaks start. 36) Seems pretty standard to pair zoom interviews and letter requests. Not unusual for me to receive a Zoom interview even before letter requests go out. 37) Interesting tidbit is that Zoom invite email stated they received >400 applications for these positions!

I thought they would have gone out by now. 45) No news on my end 12/17 x 3 46) Invited for campus interview 12/18 47) Rejection received 12/22 x2 48) Did anyone who zoomed but didn't get a campus invite get a rejection? 49) zoomed but did not receive a campus invitation or a rejection. x 4  50) Has an offer been made? x2 51) I hear two offers have been made for this search.","58","Match, exact","University of Notre Dame","IN",152080,"Notre Dame","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Classified","Great Lakes IL IN MI OH WI","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Suburb Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,2884,1160,239,201,0,4484,200815,26720,142,883,25,38,150,26,212,26,376,985,1738,1146,0,0,12683,13268,12809,12625,8874,3935,8832,22,1,19,3700,235,2193,0,238,0,NA,NA,22,52,NA,1092,0.243533,54,76,32,0.592593,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,17,13,7103,924,1254,690,710,1400,32,30,31.151515,21253,4035,0.189856,3

In particular: no, the short deadline does not mean it's intended for an internal candidate. No reference letters required up front. Open to non-Canadians. 2) Should we interpret 'freshwater ecology' as fisheries related for this call? 3) Dept member here. @2: no. Like the ad says, fisheries are one area of interest, but not the only one. If we were only looking for a fisheries ecologist, the ad would've said that. 4) I'll apply. The blog post was very useful; it gave context to the state of the dept. Thanks for doing this.*3 5) Dept member here who spoke to someone on the search committee. There were roughly 100-150 applicants, split roughly evenly between Canadian and non-Canadian. 6) 100+ wow, that's encoraging, thanks for the infor 7) I guess fairly common for a university in a major city to receive this number of applicants. 8) Calgary prof here. This is more applications than we'd typically receive in this dept. Not sure why--could be many factors, or just happenstance.But yes, it's not rare for North American research unis in large cities to receive this many applicants: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2019/03/04/heres-some-data-on-how-many-people-apply-for-n-american-tt-faculty-positions-in-ecology-and-allied-fields/ 9) Maybe  high number of applicants because almost every single other Canadian job on this board is a Canada Research Chair or Excellence Chair, which are geared for more for senior academics (Assoc Prof). Almost no Canadian Asst. Prof positions this year on the board. 10) As a Canadian ECR, I echo that - the CERC program has, in my opinion, been a disaster for Canadian ECRs. Universities are generally facing huge deficits across the board due to cutbacks on international student permits (a complex issue in Canada that drew heat due to astronomical rental/housing prices), so a government program pumping cash directly into hiring international bigwigs has basically made all universities defer hiring assisstant profs and take this money instead to make up staffing shortages due to retirement/attrition. Canadian ECRs got screwed this year, and while I can understand the strategy of the Carney government at a national scale I am massively resentful towards this. 11) Maybe take this discussion to the General Discussion or Venting tab, since the convo no longer has anything to do with this job specifically? 12) Invited for the short interview stage 26-Sept (x3) 13) Congrats! Can I ask what your general area/system is that you work on? 14) @ 10 I'm also disappointed that there haven't been any changes to the CRC2 (yet) under the current government, but it was the previous government that put the identity criteria on the CRCs. The CERCs are the real problems for ""bigwigs"", the CRCs are the ones that are discriminatory against Canadian ECRs. 15) @13 I do mostly fish ecology at the community level. 16) Did they already do in person interviews? 17) Anyone invited for in person interviews yet? 18) @16 probably no in person interviews just yet since remote ones were recent @17 not me at least 19) Nor me 20) Don't quote me on this, but rumors are that the committee skipped the zoom interview altogether and went directly to in-person; 21) Did a zoom interview and got the in-person interview invitation 10/29 22) Fuck, thought that short interview went really well, was really hopeful for this one.

The language and title is almost identical. 1) Can confirm that offer was accepted OP) Thanks 1. So I guess this is just a second hire in the same area. x2 2) So many questions - if it's one more of the same exact position, wouldn't they want to hire who already interviewed last year? I wonder if it's worth to apply again, as I wasn't even selected for the interview step. @2) Almost always reapply. Different year, maybe different goals, maybe different folks on the SC. Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know. @2 -- definitely reapply. I've seen people get ignored the first time and get interviews the second, or go to campus interview the first tiemn and not even move to short list the second time. It really depends on a bunch of factors, including luck. If you are interested in a position, always apply! OP) There are multiple anticipated retirements in the department, hence the multiple searches in recent years. Actually a really great time to apply since there have been two hires in the past two years, and this would be the third. 3) Yes, the previous offer was accepted and the selected candidate has already joined the department. Yes, this advertisement is similar to the one from last year. The goal is to conduct a broad search to continue to build the department and to replace recent and anticipated retirements. The administration only authorized a single position last year, so it is necessary to advertise again this year. All prior applicants and all others interested are encouraged to apply. 4) is anyone else having issues with Interfolio? It says 10 documents required, I have uploaded 10 (including 3 separate PDFs for each of my references' contact information), but it still says there is something missing. If I click on ""additional documents"" (only thing I don't have something uploaded to) it looks like the normal ""recommendation"" portal, but the emails it is populating do not include any information about Fordham.

Is $90K+ for 9 months not a livable wage? 5) according to Payscale.com, cost of living in Malibu is 187% higher than the national average, including housing that is 645% higher than the national average. Median home price is $3,225,692. So, there's that. Of course, you could live in a surrounding area, but it's not like anything in that region is affordable. 6) Probably a silly question, but if I am not involved in a community of faith, is that an automatic dealbreaker? 7) @6 no, they cannot legally discriminate based on religion, though weird get around where they can give some sort of preference to people with shared faith. in practicality you do not want to work at a place like Pepperdine unless you are christian, it would be very isolating 7) @ 4, it's all relative, comparing 90k in that area to my current area would be like make 26k, which I do not classify as livable. 8) Some schools have programs to help new faculty find housing or provide on-campus. Quick search on PU found this: https://www.pepperdine.edu/reo/employee-housing/ Read for details, it still may not be a good deal. 9) @5, if nothing in the region is affordable, then how could faculty (and staff who earn less) work and live there? Pepperdine has affordable employe housing in Malibu and the surrounding neighborhoods are affordable: Santa Monica, Oxnard, Calabasas, Agoura Hills, Thousand Oaks, etc. 10) @7, yes, faith-based universities in the United States can legally discriminate in hiring on the basis of religion. Don't apply if you're not a Christian. 11) as a heads up When I applied in 2020, Pepperdine had a statement of faith on the last screen before submitting that was fairly specific and I was not comfortable signing (as a Christian who has submitted a statement of faith to other institutions).  I felt bad about asking for letters but ultimately didn't apply.  Would probably be worth looking into before putting the time into an application for 12) I feel like I have seen (and not applied) to this job for a couple (a few) years in a row. Anyone know what the deal is? 13) SC here. Feel free to contact me if you are a prospective applicant and want to discuss the position before submitting an application. 14) @11, was it a declaration of ""accepting jesus christ as your lord and savior"" or was it more intense than that? That's all I can find from googling. 15) @9, subsidized housing aside, to answer your Q: a.) they don't live comfortably, b.) they come from a relatively well-off family, c.) they have a spouse that makes more, and/or d.) like you mentioned, they're ok with a longish commute (though it's a stretch to call some of those surrounding areas you listed ""affordable"").  16) I just went through the application process. Pepperdine does NOT have a statement of faith on the last screen before submitting. 17) Any news? Also, did they change their job ad to be LESS research oriented? (i.e. no longer ask for research statement?) 18) They're asking for research statement and letters of rec from those they want to interview. 19) Any news after zoom?","4","Match, exact","Pepperdine University","CA",121150,"Malibu","Doctoral/Professional Universities","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Single program-Education","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority graduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Not Classified","Far West AK CA HI NV OR WA","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Suburb Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,946,1487,66,167,0,2666,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,66,305,1349,485,461,0,0,8824,10579,9554,7136.666667,3459,6095,3131,326,1,1,2796,3299,726,7,89,46,NA,NA,20,52,NA,945,0.354464,41,30,6,0.146341,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,11,1,2585,510,280,600,600,1200,26,25,25.35443,11768,4925,0.418508,3

Does that mean once can choose to be permanenlty situated in the EEB dept? Missisauga and Toronto are two very different things 2) EEB alumnus here, probably not. You will likely be based at UTM and involved in tri-campus service, like sitting on student committees. 3) Note: ""This position is an excellent opportunity for individuals working on any organism that does not require the use of animal care facilities"" 4)@1, could you expand on the difference between UTM and U of T? 5) U of T is the main, St. George campus downtown in Toronto. UTM is the satellite campus in Mississauga (which is part of the GTA but west of the the downtown). Because Toronto is the worst city in the world, they are about 30 km apart but it takes an hour to drive between them. 6) An hour in good traffic :)  7) UTM has a nice campus and Mississauga is very family-friendly 8) Echoing 7) here. Mississauga is very green and the campus sits on Erindale Park and the Credit River. If you live near a GO train station then it takes no time to get to downtown Toronto. Alternatively, several faculty live in west end Toronto and commute. Salary and start-up are the same across campuses and you're very much a member of the EEB and CSB groups. 9) I grew up in Mississauga - the campus is in a nice place and very family friendly. You can get a pretty decent startup if you advocate for yourself. 10) The ad is a bit sparse on details for statement length etc. Is it reasonable to assume a 3-4 page research statement, 1 page teaching statement ish? 10) Teaching load? 11) No specific guidelines were offered for page limits. I would assume the following for those making last minute submissions: 1-2 pg cover letter, 2-pg research statement, 1-pg diversity statement, and a teaching dossier (good luck if you've never created one; Dalhousie has guidelines on how to create one and it is not overly burdensome).12)Any updates on this? 13) @12 my dear comrade, it closed less than 24 hours ago!

There may be more but it seems to be uncommon. 18) I've had zoom interviews at two canadian unis and straight to on-campus at two, so it seems like a mixed bag, depending on seach committee etc. 19) Zoom interview offered 12/8 20) congratulations @ 19 give'm hell x5 21) in the zoom interview the SC mentioned the in-person interviewees would be notified in early January- anyone have any updates? 22) @21 I was told the same - no word from them yet x2 23) Looks like my application is closed on the portal (Jan 16) so I'm probably out.

I am one of the zoom folks - high teaching experience (combined 14 semesters of instructor of record / TA) but a relatively weak pub record (~10 pubs), but I will ad that my package didn't get me a zoom at Villanova - I get the vibe this department is very teaching-focused department and that maybe they care more about teaching experience and training than publication rate. My area of focus is eco/evo/devo in a non-model insect group. 13) @10 I got this too, (and yes, love this from them, instead of ghosting) does this mean like a waitlist for zoom?. 14) @12) May I also ask what career stage you are, e.g., new or more senior postdoc? @12) I am senior postdoc, starting 3rd year of 2nd postdoc, 5th year in total of postdocing 15) Zoom invitee- conservation ecology, ~10 pubs, 8 semesters TAing, starting 3rd yr total of postdocing, 2 postdocs.

Often these stupid requirements (50 pubs??) come out when they have someone in mind. 3) haha what a joke! x8 4) jesus, what early career reseacher has 50 publications? 5) I'm like 1% eligible for this position lol 6) I've got about 45, but I'm marginally ECR and I don't have a job either. 7) Eh, I qualify easily and don't have a permanent job and I know several others in the same position. Unfortunately I'm geographically constrained. Strict number limits are obviously dumb, but it's way more common in searches I've seen to hire underqualified than overqualified candidates, so I guess that won't happen in this case. 8) Also, if it is an internal candidate with 50 pubs who needs a permanent job, they should absolutely hire that person anyway! x2 9) @ 4, 8 I have >60 and am still in the ECR bracket without a TT job. There's been a lot of targeted discrimination in academic hiring over the last decade - as 7 points out there's often no way to justify the hires objectively. It's actually nice to see standards here for a change. 8) It says 50 publications which is unreasonable OR 500 citations, which is not hard. Come on, people, learn how to read. Portuguese universities are very inbred and they need these type of calls to remove internal candidates which have managed contract after contract despite accomplishing very little. It is a not the best strategy in the long term, but it is meant to address these cases of inbreeding and ""old wood"" that is not that old.  9) I think these stats ae basically being very open to applicants that they want definitive productivity demonstrated.  I know MANY people who exceed all of these metrics before exiting a postdoc.  However, MOST people would not hit these numbers until at least a couple of years into an assistant professor position.  The largest majority of people in higher education actually never reach these numbers, ahving been trapped in teaching sweaat shops for too long. 10) the only way a person pre postdoc would meet any of these citation or publication metrics is by being a part of a well known and productive lab in which they were a co-author on every publication put out during their PhD whether they did any work on that project or not. This kind of thing incentivizes and necessitates gratuitous co-authorships. Also @(8) 500 citations is ""easy""?? again what early career academic at the postdoc level has 500 citations without being co-author on dozens of papers they had little to no part of, and only in fields that have really high citation metrics. In a lot of ecology you are lucky to get 50 citations with 10 papers if your field is niche. 11) I won't argue whether the metric is a good idea or not 10, but there are tons of postdoc/research associate ecologists who don't have permanent positions yet and have way more than 500 citations.","","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sounds like a great opportunity...too bad it is only Assoc/Full. 4) weird that multiple ppl turned down offers must not be that great of an opportunity no 3 5) speculation starting up.... still, i know a couple of fac members and they seem happy, so im really curious what the deal is with this position 6) most likely all of those professors were using their job offer as a competing offer for one reason or another. 7) Oxford is quite rural, so that doesn't work well for a lot of people (e.g. two body problem). 8) Curious to know the types of disciplies that short listed last time. The position says ecosystem ecology or related. 9) Their seminar list is publically available 10) Any area of ecology will be considered. 11) The seminar list requires one to log in to access. 12) The location is rural and not super desirable. The college has financial/enrollment issues outside of the sciences (which are strong). Like 7 said, two body problem or general lifestyle could be a big consideration even if the department itself is great. And by definition anyone getting an offer already had a TT job somewhere else so this would have to be better enough to be worth moving. Seems not all that surprising that it would be tricky to fill. 13? What is the salary at assoc and Full?? (x2 -- I'm curious too) 13) salaries are public so you can google them and find out what the current range is in the department. 14) Any updates? 15) Zoom interview about 2 weeks ago, but nothing since then. 16) no updates? 17) They've definitely done campus interviews already (I was not one of them, but I spied the seminar schedule). 18 - how did you spy on the seminar schedule? 19) It was on their social media","3","Match, by alias","Miami University-Oxford","OH",204024,"Oxford","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, no medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Great Lakes IL IN MI OH WI","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"Town Fringe","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,5139,898,67,0,0,6104,21808,2681,16,627,11,6,24,26,41,26,486,412,1971,3168,0,65,19716,21667,18880,17654.666667,16522,2358,16030,388,49,55,963,1395,3801,23,179,3,NA,NA,26,52,NA,1300,0.212975,86,55,35,0.406977,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",1,0,0,20,6,8179,1121,3154,580,580,1160,24,24,24,26844,24684,0.919535,3

Just saying. 13) @12 ""I'm just telling it like it is"" has been used to excuse bad behavior for decades; that's not an actual reubuttal. And I sincerely doubt the ""oh, no, full professors are taking all the jobs!"" people will themselves decide never to move one day, lest they become hypocrites (PS, this has been debunked many times; see Jeremy Fox's posts in Dynamic Ecology). 14) I posted 12 more as an FYI about senior positions rather than responding to anything in this thread specifically. 15) @11 I know many of the members of this department and I would speculate they want people who are pretty ""ecosystem"" heavy. I would think biogeochemistry and ecosystem metabolism, cycling of matter and energy, nutrient dynamics, etc. Having a conservation or organismal tie-in might not be a bad idea though because they are land grant and have the Warnell School of Forestry with potential collaborators.  16) @11, the Dean's official line is ""if your response variable is a pool or a flux, then it counts as ecosystem ecology for the purposes of these positions"". 17) Are references requested at time of submission? 18) @17 listed right on the main page of the job announcement (yes, names and contact info for 3 references). 19) Looks like with a standard 10x multiplier for this site, there are at least 200 applications. Tough job market right now. 20) last time they had a single job in this dept they had 365 applications, i imagine it's way more than 200h, 21) Letters of rec requested 9/26. 22) Were candidates notified or your letter writers informed you? just want to know that before I move on. 21) I was informed by my letter writer, not notified myself 22) oof, painful X4 21) on-campus interview, 23) on campus interview as in there were invitations out already and were you on the terretrial or aquatic side? 24) Also received on campus invite, terrestrial side, 21) I'm on the aquatic side. 25) did anyone else recieve an offer?

Great university, one of the best in Latin America. São Paulo has a lot of money for research. Salary is good. But before anyone gets excited, I suggest you investigate the hiring process in Brazil: which insluded writen exams (taken in portuguese IN SÃO PAULO!). Another Brazilian here. Some processes offer the possibility to do the test in English. To be honest, it's a bogus system - they use these tests because they're too lazy to properly review every applicant's CV and research record. Yes, the exam is required by law, but universities are too lazy to confront this requirement and design a more effective process that actually evaluates research merit. At the end, you read your test to the professors evaluating you, and they throw scores as they please to pass the candidates they want - increasing the score here and there for the ones they favor, decreasing for others. Bottom line: after the whole process that involves a 5-hour long test, a mock lecture, an interview... the committee president tries to convince the other members to pick the candidate he wants. The selection is subjective like all selections are, but they include this long test only to make things worse. @Brazilians: just to clarify - fluency in portguese is required to pass this exam? Im in the same institute, different department. English is in principle not required for the exam, but you do need to have your PhD diploma validaded by the university BEFORE the application date, so this should be started immediatelly. There are instructions in the full job posting. I should add that the desire to hire more broadly is sincere, but would be against the norm. There is a Canadian in the department (Taran Grant) that could be contacted for an honest assessment of your chances.","","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Under the 3/2 model, there is a course reduction for the first year. It’s important to note that class sizes are small, and upper-level labs (200 and 300-level) count as a full course, meaning a lecture and its associated lab together count as two courses. Also, the only course with multiple lab sections is Introductory Biology, and those labs are taught by dedicated faculty members. 3) Note that letters of rec are required up front and before the review date 4) It looks like the letters are due on 9/15, is that not correct? 3 again) I just meant before the review date so you can have your entire application in by 9/15 5) It looks like the interfolio site has a feature that lets you request letters from your references so they have the option to upload letters themselves. 6) Can we submit the application on Interfolio before the letters are uploaded, or do we need to wait for the letters to show up? 5) again- @6- I was able to submit my application without the letters. 7) Search committee member here: please submit your application without waiting for your references to upload their letters. 8) ""research program that includes a field or laboratory component"" - does this mean there is not much point applying as a theory/modeling researcher? 9) Any updates? 10) nope! x7 11) Zoom invitation 9/29 x6 12) congrats all! can I please ask what career stage, how many pubs, area of expertise to those who got interviews?

It was fun figuring this out. 11) any updates? 12) zoom invitation 9/30 x4 13) would any of the zoom invites be willing to share ecology specialty, career stage, number of pubs, etc.?  14) Did anyone get an idea of the timeline for the search after the Zoom? 15) On campus interview invitation 10/21 16) Got the official rejection letter today (4Dec2025) saying they had made an offer and it was accepted. x3","26","Match, exact","Lafayette College","PA",213385,"Easton","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences plus professions, no graduate coexistence","Not classified (Exclusively Undergraduate)","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Exclusively undergraduate four-year","Four-year, small, highly residential","Classified","Mid East DE DC MD NJ NY PA","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Suburb Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,779,0,0,0,0,779,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,611,168,0,0,2662,2701,2514,2476,2514,0,2457,32,0,25,0,0,606,0,7,0,NA,NA,15,45,NA,286,0.367137,34,0,0,0,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,0,0,0,2536,455,178,620,630,1250,28,26,26.562401,8215,2922,0.355691,3

At UQAM you can get by in english here and there. Although Saguenay is relatively touristy, applicants should expect all work-related matters to be in french and pretty big push from colleagues to speak french. 4) Should the application be in French or would English work? 5) English would probably fly but a substantial fraction of the SC may, at least internally, frown on it. If youre on paper the perfect candidate they may take you in for an interview. Expect questions in french at the interview, both with and without warning. The language push here is intense but understandable. Imagine going to Toronto only speaking french and not even trying to order or say thank you in English.

I posted this and am loosely involved in the search and work in the dept. I'm an eco person myself, and know a lot of eco/evo people who do genetics that could easily handle an intro class and have interesting upper-levels to share at the cell/molec scale that are not biomedical. Honestly, I'd be happy to see more applicants that span topics beyond biomed applications (yeast evolution! disease pathways in non-model systems, etc). That said, I am not chairing the search, but wanted the job ad to be widely viewed in a space like this because not all people who work in genetics are coming out of MCB PhD/post-docs. ALSO, to address the upper-level classes, I would think preference is towards classes that touch on molec/cell, but for instance, that could still be in eco/evo world too - for instance, we have a biogeographer/entomologist, but not a population geneticist, etc etc. 3) @2 Are you open to bacteria people who do genetics? 4) I think if you can teach courses related to genetics you are a good fit to be an applicant. The species/model of interest is secondary to the ability to teach genetics. Please refer to job ad for detail! 5) any news? 6) Job ad says ""candidates should be prepared to provide three letters of reference by October 1, 2025, if requested"". Given that, folks should hear back this week. maybe? 7) True, but the letter requests were already made during the application, right? 8) @7, 6 here: During the application, they requested the contact information of the reference. It seems that they requested letters yesterday because I was notified by academicJobsOnline.org that one of my references uploded the letter. Must admit though that I am confused if we were supposed to initiate the request by clicking that green arrow? Any thoughts? 9) I used interfolio emails for my ref letters and they were requested/uploaded when I submitted the application on 9/15. 10) so how do we know if our applications have made the initial cut? 9) no idea, just crossing my fingers for a zoom invite in the next week or two. 11) @8 I clicked on those arrows and put in the letters at the same time as I was submitting the applicaiton. Fingers crossed for next week. 12) I didn't click those green arrows. But they have requested letters from my references yesterday, which means I am not out of it yet. 13) @12, you got an email from them requesting letters? I am confused--I never clicked the green arrows but I assume if I didn't get a request, I'm out. 14) @13 My letter writers got email request to submit reference letters. I don't know if I was supposed to send/arrange these letter at the time of application, but I am hoping that I am still in the pool. I think, my opinian only, if candidates have already attached letters from, say interfolio (see above), at the time of application then they are still in the pool because there is no way to know if someone is out or in. Only way to find that out is to get email notifications for Zoom. 13) My letter writers did not receive requests for letters and I did not click the arrow to request these. I am presuming I shouldn't request AJO to send them notifications and that I would hear directly from Macalester if I needed to submit them. 14) This makes sense, next week or two will make it clear. 9) wish I hadn't used interfolio so I would know if I'm still in the running! x3. 15) Any Zoom interview invitations?  15) It does seem like you were supposed to request the letters directly through academicjobsonline if that's the platform you used per clicking the ""?"" icon next to reference letters on the job ad. 16) I did not request letters myself, but my writers were contacted last week 15) seems like the instructions were wrong then. Good luck to all of us! 9) Zoom interview invite received 10/3 x4 9) Onsite invite recieved 10/21 10) when? 9) Dates offered early-mid November 9) Offer made to another (via future PI slack) 11) official rejection letter 12) they hired a microbiologist, btw.

I am interested but don't know what exactly they are looking for with this combo of skills. 2) The wording was a little funny in the listing. Would the lab just be for Masters or PhDs too? I thought Villanova was a R2 school 3) Villanova's bio department has a terminal master's program but not a PhD program. 4) ""For finalists, an official graduate transcript will be required and a reflection on the Mission of the University."" How deeply is this reflection tied to the religious affiliation of the school? Any concept on the strength of religious befliefs in teaching and culture? 5) @4 FWIW: I was a grad student there in the late aughts and at least at that time, there was no strong connection between religious belief and teaching or research. Heck, the science building is Mendel Hall, as in the Augustinian monk and ""father"" of genetics Gregor Mendel. From my perspective, there was a deep respect for science and little, if any, direct connection (really none at all from my perspective) between religion and the functioning of the department. 6) I also was a grad student there around 10 years ago and I can second what 5 is saying. That said, I think a lot of the student body identifies as Catholic and there are crucifixes in every room lol 7) Went here as an undergrad (many years ago now) and it never felt like a ""religious"" school. Theology, ethics, and philosophy are required classes for all students, but weren't exclusively catholic. Biology classes were just as secular as non-religious schools. Honestly, fewer anti-abortion protestors on campus compared to the public R1 I attended for grad school. 8) I am confused about the definition of organismal ecologists--is this wording used to specifically exclude population and community elements to the study of organisms? confused because of the juxtaposition of organismal ecology with quantitative/computational components... 9) note that in the listing it says review starts Sept 2 but closing date is Sept 5; 10) SC member here: Answering a few questions: The job ad is specifically broad as we want to find the best candidate for our department. We are looking for someone who can combine ecological/computational expertise - organismal does not exclude pop or community but more focuses on multicellular organisms/communities. We are an R2 with a terminal master's in Biology. We will begin reviewing applications on Sept 2nd. VU while a catholic school does not dictate what we teach or how we run our classrooms/research labs. The reflection on the mission does not need to be religiously focused and should rather highlight how you can move the mission of the university forward with your teaching and research program. 11) That's super helpful 10, thank you! x3 12) just a heads up there are not separate places to upload the undergrad and grad transcripts. Mine were two separate docs so if you are in the same shoes you either need to merge the docs or figure out another place to stick one of the transcipt documents - I put mine in the ""optional response to mission statement"" section, hopefully the SC gets it. 13) Zoom interview invitation received 09/14. x3 14) wow that was a fast turnaround congrats @ 13 et al. 14) Feeling pretty bummed about not reaching the zoom interview stage for this one--would love to know what types of CVs got to that stage. X7 15) @14 what type of information are you looking for? 16) Not 14, but I'm curious about taxa/level of study. I also thought I was a great fit. Oh well. 17) @16 insect ecology w/ a focus on native pollinators/population ecology. 18) @16 behavioral ecology with focus on fitness and life history consequences of behavioral plasticity in rodents (edit @19: 6th year postdoc, 17 publications). 19) Follow up to 14: curious about general things like career stage (assist. prof, 2nd year postdoc, 6th year postdoc), publications (how many), etc. That type of info would be very helpful for better understanding why we weren't considered and could help us with our packages in the future. Thanks in advance. x2 20) Try not to get too down if you didn't get a zoom - I have been really competitive making it to at least zoom interviews for PUI type jobs and I didn't get one either, it seems like this cycle is extra competitive and folks with R1 type publication records are in the ring too. Remember there is so much stochasticity in hiring and you probably have a package that will be competitive elsehwere. you got this! 21) on-campus interview request 10/6 x2 22) offer received 12/8 22) offer officially accepted 1/21","26","Match, exact","Villanova University","PA",216597,"Villanova","R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: STEM-dominant","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","High undergraduate","Four-year, medium, highly residential","Classified","Mid East DE DC MD NJ NY PA","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Suburb Large","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,2245,1261,24,178,0,3708,20414,5091,8,641,0,2,16,6,18,6,423,1016,978,1267,0,0,10848,12231,11032,9134,7037,3995,6793,187,0,57,1392,2603,1693,7,61,7,NA,NA,24,52,NA,1397,0.376753,47,43,25,0.531915,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,21,3,5400,1020,667,650,670,1320,30,28,28.790753,22083,6770,0.306571,3

Additionally, while I was teaching at a neighboring institution, there were rumblings about the financial instability at this school. 4) SC member here – The breadth of possible elective courses for the position is intended to allow a wide range of applicants because we are open to expanding our department in several different directions within the areas of ecology, evolution, and behavior. As for financial stability, we do live in the reality of being a tuition-dependent liberal arts college, but I think overall we are heading in the right direction (proactive problem solving, enrollments increasing year over year for the past 4 years, etc). 5) Re:financial stability - Looks as though they've been running an $8 million deficit the last two tax years: https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/410695524, which is about 5% of their operations.

Since 2017, WSU has led research into elk hoof disease since the Washington State Legislature provided generous operating funding and a mandate to monitor and assess causes of and potential solutions for the disease. More information on WSU’s research and outreach on elk hoof disease is available at: https://vetmed.wsu.edu/departments/veterinary-microbiology-and-pathology/elk-hoof-disease/ - @5 just let us make jokes from our little corner of the ivory tower we have so little joy left x2 7) There's an epidemic of overly-tailored job ads. It really puts me on the back foot. 8) @7 hopefully your back foot does not get elk hoof disease; 9) SCM here - just to keep you all on your 'toes' (hooves?), the review date has been updated to August 17, 2025. Can the spreadsheet owner help us update the review date?
