Vision statement = research statement. BI statement = DEI statement. Having 3 published papers to attach as reprints should be easy. Cover letter and CV are standard job packet components. x2 4) I like the vision statement (despite the cheesy name). The instructions are very clear about what that document should contain, moreso than for most research statements.x3 5) Have to agree. Sometimes the top tier schools are pretty agregious but this seems like a fancy way of describing the standard materials. 6) That vision statement request is pretty different from nearly every research statement I've read x2 7) I guess this answers the question from the Venting Tab, ""Who determines the standard?"" 8) Is this worth applying to for folks who study evolution? 9) In their last round, lots of people were notified as 'tier 1' applicants who then somehow were not interviewed - is there any point in re-applying, or does this mean that those folks simply did not meet the search criteria and should let it go? 10) How many is ""lots of people""? From the message I saw, it read as if there were only ~10.. 11) @9, if the last search had a different focus, worth reapplying. Also worth reaching out the SC if you made the long list but weren't called to see if you fit for this search.  12) Is this worth applying if i dont have a CNS paper? 13) @12 tbh no, look at who got hired last time and make your decision that way. 14) CNS isn't required, but a previous stint at an Ivy, specifically Harvard, definitely helps. 15) It's an open rank position. They may be hiring someone with tenure, so I think it's reasonable for them to ask for a little more in the way of an application. 16) GREAT department.

Winter temperatures in the -20s or -30s F are not at all uncommon. Summers are very buggy as well. But it's a beautiful area with lots of outdoor recreation opportunities in both summer and winter. The nice thing about the cold is that the snow actually sticks around and is beautiful, instead of immediately turning to brown slop. Also, the winters aren't as gray as they are on, say, the East Coast. Once you get past mid-January, it tends to be pretty sunny. 5) I lived in northern MN for a couple years and I miss it. It is one of the most gorgeous places in the country, Itasca being one of my favorites. The people are amazing. I seriously miss it and would highly suggest giving it a try for anyone on the fence. 6) I wonder if the pay range will be low. The position seems classified for a BS level. 4) Yeah, they're willing to take someone with a BS but prefer MS or PhD. Kind of a weird qualifications spread, so hard to say what the pay is. Though cost of living would be very low there. 7) I thought it was interesting there was a statement about temp housing for this position and did look up houses for sale/rent. From what I can see online are fairly few and far between, though I'm not from around there so any insight could help others... based on the prices of the homes though that may indicate a lower pay range due to lower COL 8) Yes, few houses are available up there. The population density is very low. It may be hard to find a house. 9) I lived up here for a couple years.  we had an amazing house on a modest salary. However, it's rural, conservative and very different since 2016.  It ain't the twin cities, but it's also full of natural beauty.","","University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","alias","MN",174066,"Minneapolis","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, higher transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily nonresidential","Classified","Plains IA KS MN MO NE ND SD","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Large","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","Yes",0,8887,3136,669,950,0,13642,999314,43068,2026,3254,81,83,389,115,551,114,1201,2885,4850,4037,0,14,51327,63760,52017,42937.666667,36061,15956,28529,2378,460,4694,9409,6547,5920,46,1823,125,NA,NA,27,52,NA,1817,0.133192,96,234,68,0.708333,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,26,22,7414,858,5422,600,640,1240,25,26,25.136624,38237,26628,0.696394,3

When I was a student there, no faculty did much research. However, the department is much younger now and I think they have started prioritizing undergraduate research opportunities more than they used to. I know faculty there occasionally served on undergraduate honors thesis comittees, but I wouldn't expect a lot of opportunities to advise graduate students. It's also worth noting that the campus is approximately an hour drive from Emory's main campus in Atlanta and serves only first and second year students. After the second year, they continue their undergraduate education on the Atlanta campus. 4) Interviewed here a while back and had a positive experience. Ended up not accepting a multi-year teaching instructor renewable position, but found the SC collegial.

There are classes and programs in Jesuit philosophy / theology available for undergraduates, and a fellowship available for women in the sciences at Catholic colleges (Clare Booth Luce; many of our PhD students have this fellowship and don't teach for a few years. You don't have to be Catholic to get it). There are some Jesuit brothers living on campus, and a few still teaching. But day to day Fordham's Jesuit affiliation has zero impact on faculty outside of theology or other narrow programs (and Jesuits do not deny evolution FWIW). The mission statement of the university says something about the university being for people of all faiths and no faith. The new president of Fordham is the first non-Jesuit to hold that post (and the first woman). 5)Just want to chim in that I did my undergraduate degree in biochemistry at a different Jesuit institution and my intro biology professor was a Jesuit- I literally learned evolution from a priest.

Search failed last year. (2) Any insight into why it failed or what they might be looking for; i.e., what we might emphasize--if we have it--in our apps? (3) why do searches fail when so many people are desperate for jobs? (4) the search last year failed because the person that was offered the job accepted another position  5) Person, Singular?  Only one person worth employing?  This institution usually gets lots of applicants. 6) @5 its more common than you think. They probably wanted that person specifically and didn't even look at other apps 7) @3 you're essentially hiring a colleague for life. sometimes a search doesn't bring in anyone that the faculty feels is the right fit. depending on the nature of the funding for the position, they'll often cut bait and wait until the following year or even later in the hope of generating a different applicant pool.  (8) my understanding is that it failed because of dysfunctional department politics. this department is notorious for that (see discussion in General Discussion and in Venting this year and last). What I heard is some search committee members didn't even schedule meetings with non-offered candidates. This department also has a history of interviewing nationals from the developing world to fill out diversity quotas but categorically will not offer to them. Very likely most of the interviewed candidates weren't given serious consideration.  9) Search members not meeting candidates and not seeing talks would be an HR violation at my school that could pull the search completely.  Seems rude to candidates as well.  Past searches have not handled COIs well.  It makes me think this school does not value fair hiring practices if they let those practices continue.  It's a shame because it is such a great school. (10) @7 -- when you get well-over triple-digit apps, if you can't find a ""colleague for life"" it is perhaps because the faculty is not willing to expand their view of their ideal colleague. x2 (11) maybe this is a department that needs to clear house after a few big name people retire. x3 (12) This is one salty, bitter job board; I thought gossip and venting were reserved for other pages? x6  13) @12, seems like a lot of useful information to me. (14) useful but take it with many grains of salt x2 [personal attack deleted, while I ponder how to clean up the rest of this borderline appropriate discussion -AP] (15) Please don't let this unfounded speculation discourage you from applying. In my experience it's quite an amazing environment for new faculty! x5 16) @15, if you are one of the people who makes it past the interview issues, then I'm sure it is.  That doesn't mean they did right by all candidates on their past searches.  x3 (17) I'm in this dept as postdoc and have no idea why people here are so negative. This place rules, and everyone should apply for this job. x2 (18) previous postdoc with one of the 'bigwigs' - not a great Dept. 19) Good dept or not, good luck living in Vancouver on this salary - unless your partner happens to make the same or preferably much, much more. @19, what is the salary, I don't see it in the ad? (20) expect between 110-145 depending on experience (12 month), is my best guess. (21) The university provides faculty housing (22) @18 why is the dept ""not great""? Are you talking about Zoology? Everyone I know who's either worked or studied there is fantastic and has loved it aside from the usual gripes about vancouver housing. Super collegial, collaborative and interdisciplinary department with a strong sense of community among students and faculty. 23) @18 and @22, the word you're looking for is ""quaint"" 24) seems like people's experiences of UBC depend on whether specific faculty members believe their research qualifies as ""evolutionary biology."" 25) as a pdoc in the dept, my impression is that the search failed last year because they were looking for someone to fill the macroevolution methods void that was recently created, but the department could use some younger faculty and I speculate their search this year so as to avoid another delay in hiring such a person - p.s. the dept is great.

Boooo Dartmouth. 3) I genuinely don't get y'all. Have you never applied to anything before? My letter writers have things ready to go at a moments notice. Upfront letters shouldn't be an issue. x3 4) Sure... but I don't see a problem with anonymously shaming departments that still require them. It is a lot of extra work for writers to send say, 20-30 or more! when they could just be sending single digits each cycle 5) some of us like to submit a larger packet up front because we know our letters are positive and can help balance things that might be otherwise lacking (e.g. no CNS papers on our CV). x3 6) I'd love to think that strong letters help round out an application, but do search committees really have time to read and digest letters during the first round of screening? (genuinly asking - any search committee members that can chime in here?) 7) i've been on 4 search committees. for us asking for letters is an HR thing and we do it to not slow down the process later. not asking up front and then asking later can cause lags because of HR and paperwork. to answer your question...letters can matter a bit. a really glowing letter from someone well-accomplished who can speak directly to the applicant's fit and potential can mean a lot. also, i view whining about this as entitlement - i'd be glad to dodge a person who complained about such a minor thing for a 30-40 year job. i'm happy to submit letters for others. x4 8)Right because having glowing recommendations from old boys club is not entitlement, that and wasting the time of 3x the number of applicant's letter writers.x8 9) Its also just totally not standard outside of academia. In any other industry, only the top applicant, maybe top 2-3, get asked for references, as a last check. Your application and interviews (especially when we're talking such lengthy interviews as academia requires) should be enough to let a search committee evaluate you. All my friends in tech and other industries think its ridiculous what we do. x5 10) @ 7 - you're a colleague everyone would be lucky to avoid with a shitty attitude like that. x4 11) Letter screening by search committees often devolves into ""wow they got a letter from famous prof. so-and-so"" rather than anything about their actual content. I think they're good in weeding out the truly bad candidates but rarely add much. 12) no offense, but letters are really not the issue here. They will really only care about the nature/science papers, your pedigree and grant 13) Only the worst applicants can't get a few letters that are full of hyperbole and nonsense. Compare the culture around letters of reference in the USA vs Europe. The US model is ridiculous. Reference letters should be a final sanity check before offering the job, not a major component of the application.  14) @13 that is untrue.  EVEN the worst can get them.  15) Letters up front also cause invisible hurdles that harm certain applicants out of the gate. If a critical letter writer is a new PI and is overwhelmed with lots of things, or maybe the PI is a URM and already spends more time than others on letters, these things have cascading effects that can cause career drags on letter writers. The practice to continue to ask for letters up front is 100% problematic. I have seen the justification like 7) before that its an HR thing, but there are ways for departments to get around these issues, they are just not trying hard enough. 16) LOL the other Dartmouth job below for Indiginous Environmental Studies does NOT require letters up front. So I'm just gonna go ahead and say its BS to blame this issue on HR. This was a choice from the department and one that deserves the shaming. 17) Changing topics altogether... what's the teaching load like at Dartmouth? 18) From the other side, I have served on SCs and can say that I pay essentially no attention to letters. The top 10 applicants tend to have stellar materials, and I don't need anyone else to tell me that. I have heard my senior colleagues say things like, ""they have a letter from so-and-so, and I went to graduate school with them"", so yes, letter's are problematic. But they really do not figure into most hiring decisions in my experience. X2 19) as a young and overworked PI writing letters for students: if the job looks interesting, just apply. Worst that can happen is you don't get it. Give a polite heads up to your writers and they hopefully understand the dynamics of letter request timing being out of your control. Seems like a great job. x2 20) @8 ah yes casual ageism and sexism. someone who is well-accomplished does not need to be old or a man. actually in my experience on SCs letters tend to help URMs the most. could just be my experience. and @10 makes a personal attack rather than respond to the concept. and to the person making comparisons to industry - academia is not like industry...tenure, sabbaticals, $100k+ start-ups, extreme flexibility, 9-month contracts with summer salaries coming from external grants. there are also typically not 1-2 all-day interview processes in industry. hiring a TT person is not like hiring an employee. my take is that letters usually do not break a candidate, but in certain situations they can help especially earlier career and/or minoritized candidates (or neurodivergent as discussed on the other tab) 21) Uh, there are totally 1-2 day interview processes in STEM industry, although one full day is much more common than 2. I had a full 1 day interview for my first job out of UG lol. That job also had a ""tenure"" of sorts --- after 6 years employees were allowed to do up to 6mo leave w/o pay, which is not super uncommon. Sure no startup, but how much does it cost to train a new employee in the business? often at least $100k. So yeah, there are plenty of similarities and absolutely no reason why best practices in ""normal"" hiring can't be used in academia. 22) Can we circle back to the teaching load question that @17 asked? 23) I used to be a grad student there and teaching load is relatively low, if I understand it correctly. Dartmouth is on a 1/4 and not semester system and I believe profs only teach 2/4, but: grad courses don't count as teaching, so often profs do that as extra. Otherwise, must be a pretty good gig although high pressure for prestigious pubs and grants. 24) @AP Would you please consider relocating some of the tangential reference letter discussion (plus this comment)?

Can't imagine applying for this (9) #6 here again, I am an organismal biologist who is solidly EEB, and I have to say this is odd from my perspective.

(7 again) let's not gatekeep too much based on our own biases of how ""small"" our fields should be. I strongly consider myself an evolutionary biologist with eco tilt yet there are plenty of jobs listed I don't qualify for. This is one I do. Why is teaching human biology automatically outside of evolution? Plenty of extremely well-known evo biologists who focus on form/morphology/anatomy have taught human anat. This is not a marginal ecoevo job and it absolutely makes sense to be on this sheet.

Plus, the vertebrate eeb/organismal biology community has a long history of getting hired as anatomy faculty. (15) @14 that'd be a totally valid point if Brown Med weren't pushing to transition to a prosection-based model. Anatomy jobs are a gamble these days. (16) This posting is a bit odd, innit? ""Hey do some organismal biology, but oh you have to teach about humans too."" It is odd in that they're going to set aside millions of dollars to hire a tenure-track professor to teach one class when the new prof likely researches something else. (17) the combination of human anatomy and EEB is a stereotypical and extremely common position listing for vertebrate paleontologists, if you talk to many paleontologists that is in fact their job description for teaching. many paleontologists work at medical schools and their graduate training specifically prepares them for this. not sure why this is a controversial posting x1 (18) It's controversial because some people just lose their minds when a posh job is posted and they're not a fit for it. x2 19) In case some people missed it. Teaching gross anatomy to med students involves human cadavers so is different than an undergrad A&P. To each their own comfort level. 20) AMEN TO @18 YOU SAID THAT EXACTLY RIGHT. My goodness.. this needs to be said more often. 21) Anyone know the search chair? 22) Elizabeth Brainerd is the search chair. 23) This dept has a number of labs that focus on comparative biomechanics (some with paleo focus) and these folks take care of human anatomy classes because it pays the bills & human anatomy is a rare and specific expertise to hire someone to study specifically (as 14 said) .

It's actually heartening to see a VAP--who has already given to the school--be recognized as a good colleague with the promise of a long career. No need to butt them out with ""the latest and greatest shiny new thing"" when a great candidate is right there. Normalize steady careers and locations! 4) @2 & 3, I don't think the complaint is about them hiring the VAP, but about lots of other good candidates applying, thinking they have a chance, even interviewing. I have gone on three on campus interviews where an internal candidate was ultimately hired. I spent so much time prepping and traveling for those, and I just wish they had promoted the internal candidate without a national search (yes, this is possible at some places). At least this one seems very obvious and gives a super short turnaround so maybe it won't waste too many people's time. 5) Agree with 4. I'm not annoyed with a VAP being hired for a permanent position--that should be normalized! I'm annoyed that institutions still run a national search for internal promotions of that nature, which takes up other people's time and energy. That also happened to me last season. Doing all of the prep and practice for an on campus interview ate up a lot of my time and it was all for naught.","2","Middlebury College","FALSE","VT",230959,"Middlebury","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences focus, some graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Single program-Other","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Very high undergraduate","Four-year, small, highly residential","Classified","New England CT ME MA NH RI VT","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Town Distant","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,839,192,5,0,0,1036,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,0,177,15,774,65,0,0,2657,4616,2669,2591,2580,89,2551,20,1,8,0,89,602,0,5,0,NA,NA,17,45,NA,266,0.256757,38,11,5,0.131579,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,3,1,2556,383,262,670,670,1340,31,28,29.218605,9174,2022,0.220405,3

Beautiful area though 4) I am a current faculty member at Southern Oregon University (SOU), but I am not affiliated with this search: Indeed, SOU is a small, regional, public university with a high teaching load (~12 contact hours per term) and low research expectations (~1 paper required for tenure). Like many regional universities, SOU has struggled financially (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2023/03/22/president-proposes-steep-job-cuts-save-his-institution), but I (and I think many other faculty members) are optimistic about the future. This position could be a great fit for an environmental scientist who would enjoy teaching during the school year and mentoring students through research during the summer. Here is some more information about SOU and faculty life there: a) Faculty salaries increase 2-3% every year based on explicit salary tables outlined in the collective bargaining agreement; b) Many faculty enjoy comfortable lives in Ashland at the current salaries, but the cost of housing makes buying a home difficult for new faculty. Being a dual-income household helps, of course; c) Many faculty still own homes in Ashland and surrounding cities; d) Ashland, OR is an amazing place to live and do research, especially for environmental scientists and ecologists; and e) The administration is actively growing environmental degree programs and research programs. If you are an environmental scientist who loves teaching and wants to live in a vibrant small town with near-perfect weather, amazing restaurants, abundant public lands, and world-class theater, then you should consider SOU. 5) This isn't an ecology or evolution listing though 6) @5 The ad specifically mentions soil science and ecohydrology.

The USEPA defined an EVS PHD as someone with a multidisiplinary degree drawing from Social, natural, and physical sciences.  The recommended background was courses in env. policy/law, environmental biology, environmental chemistry/geology, and later, env. sociology was added.  this was published many years ago in Science.  However, most programs are poor-man's ecology or chemistry programs with little real interdisciplinary nature.  An EVS person should have an emphasis in one of the four areas.  But, they should have no problem teaching a few freshman courses in any of the other fields.

Evolutionary biologists who use molecular and cellular tools are encouraged to apply. Great place to work in a growing department with new building, new greenhouse, and more hires anticipated.  Starting salary range $90-98.5K.  2) sounds great - any chance of associate-level hiring (unlikely I'm sure, but thought I'd ask). 3). The position has only been approved at the assistant level, but we would be interested in advanced assistants with credit towards tenure.  Unlikely that associate-level hire would be approved, but very manageable tenure expectations 4) What's teaching load like here?  5) I believe the teaching load is 13.5 credits a year.  One example of how this roughly works is to teach ~2 sections of a (often the same) course one semester (6 credits; e.g., 2 sections of intro bio) and an upper division lab that you would prep the second semester (e.g., lecture + lab for the same course; ~7 credits).

Yuck. What a waste of everyone's time. x2 (2) agree with 1 and not applying if letters required up front. X8 3) A huge ""BOOOOOO!"" to this SC. (4) legit not trolling here, but is asking for letters up front really that big of a deal? Don't most people's references have stock letters more or less put together at this point in their careers? Is this really a deal breaker? Isn't something like a 4 page tailored research statement more demanding? 6) Yes, no, yes, some of us care about other people's time besides our own (4) @6, no need to get snippy. I was just curious why this point is a deal breaker for some when other parts of the research package take much more time and effort to prepare (like a 4 vs 2 page research proposal) but aren't a deal breaker. Many people's references have letters ready from previous apps, and it doesn't take much time to tweak on their end. I actually do care about other people's time as well. Thanks for your mature and respectful response though. (7) if you fit the job description, apply. Your letter writers will not mind, trust me (from a letter writer). Best advice is to apply to as many jobs as you can, if you want a succesful job season. Not applying because of letters unneccesarily reduces your chances of an interview in a given year. x4. (8) I suggest not to post an irrelevant argument that does not help people in looking for a summarized description of useful items from the position. (9) fun fact for the ""upfront letters are gross"" crowd: your writers may get more advanced notice and prefer it that way! I usually know I'm applying 4-6 weeks ahead of time and give them notice, but when I've been invited for interviews they're usually given ~2 weeks to get their letters in. x2 (9) the entitlement and self-importance of the position of the folks who claim they don't apply for a job with letters up front is galling.

(email to EEB and do the official September 16 deadline). (2) The LSA Collegiate Fellows Program was designed to enhance diversity amongst postdocs and ECRs transitioning into faculty positions - maybe fair to assume the same is true for any associate level hires. (3) @2 The Sept 8th deadline is for other departments, not EEB (""For candidates for the following departments: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology[...]: Monday, October 16, 2023"", but the department asks to send materials directly to them by Sept 16) (4) Folks should be fully aware that these are DEI jobs and therefore adjust your effort and expectations accordingly. (5) Does this mean URMs are encouraged to apply? (6) it is not a ""DEI job"" it is a standard tenure track job in the EEB dept. URMs and those with exceptional DEI track records are especially encouraged to apply. x4 (7) Am I reading the ad correctly - could someone who is a new assistant prof at another university apply? (8) re: (7) yes that's correct x3 (4) @6 that is a very disingenuous statement. look at who has recieved these positions in the past—I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this and I strongly support these sorts of initatives, but certain people should know that they're very unlikely to be considered for the position. (9) Could someone who is in the middle of tenure-track (e.g., 2-4 year into the tenure track but not ready for promotion yet) apply? (6) re: (9) yes! 10) Yeah @4. I've just looked at the full list of awards through this program from the last 5 years and it is pretty clear that I should not waste my time. 11) Where does it say to email EEB by Sept 16? I only see the October deadline on the website 12) @11 2nd to last paragraph: ""Applications AND reference letters are due by Monday, October 16, 2023, at 11:59 p.m. ET.

(14) I had the worst interview experience of my life in this dept. Caveat emptor. (15) Do you have any ideas about how they will match the tenure-track systems of different countries, as the systems (time, terminologies) in many countries will differ from the USA? (16) Could someone please explain what is a writing sample? -> Published works (2-3 works; 35 pages maximum per writing sample). This is the first time I see this document. (17) I believe that is copies of your best publications. (18) !!Elligibility criteria  - PhD earned between 2019 and 2024!! 19) @18 this is true but only for the Collegiate Fellowship, not for the Senior Collegiate Fellowship. 20) Gosh, it is the second time I see a position at UM and it is always such a mess re: submission of application material, letters etc. It is always so confusing. I'd suggest UM to review these and make it easier for everyone. Personally, this confusion and having to submitt the letters in advance are the reason I am not applying. 21) The application link is not working for me. 22) The entire network was down for about 3 days at UMich. The link should be working now. And this search is not a mess. it is a program run through the college. You submit your materials to EEB for feedback to improve your application. Then you submit to the college at the later deadline. Reach out to the department if you have questions or are confused. 23) @14 would you mind elaborating, still thank you if not.","6","University of Michigan-Ann Arbor","alias","MI",170976,"Ann Arbor","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority undergraduate","Four-year, large, primarily residential","Not Classified","Great Lakes IL IN MI OH WI","Public, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Public",1,"City Midsize","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,8715,4691,876,750,0,15032,1572931,100931,2042,4273,79,92,628,76,788,75,2648,2793,5845,2870,0,0,48090,49530,47907,45691.666667,31329,16578,29813,1376,38,102,14733,1845,6835,44,1257,48,NA,NA,24,14,NA,2565,0.170636,76,216,59,0.776316,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,22,23,12242,4393,3277,660,680,1340,31,28,29.281747,65021,16974,0.261054,3

I think this is a great position for someone who is entirely focused on research and has no interest in teaching or outreach. You can build your own research program, but institutional support is more limited than what you would generally find at a traditional academic institution. There is a lot of pressure to bring in large federal grants, but if you feel confident in your ability to do so, it can be an excellent opportunity for the correct person. 4). I'm a scientist at Cary. Salary is competetive with top notch institutions. It is a hard money position with a community goal of recovering a portion of salary. Feel free to reach out to the search committee with any questions. Many many opportunities for outreach and teaching if interested. Communitity is caring and egaged. 5) I was also a field tech at Cary and I disagree with the statement that this is a position for someone who ""has no interest in outreach or teaching"". Not being a University does mean there is less teaching, but there are still plenty of opportunities to teach if the scientist is interested. Also, the amount of outreach Cary scientists do is often more than a tradition academic position due to the time release of not having consistent teaching requirements. 6) @4 I am curious about the faciltites at the institute, is there any opportunity to chat with someone before hand? I could not find information about labs and othr facilties on the webpage. 4) @6. The search committee is listed on the ad and enthusiastic to speak to folks. reach out to ask about facilities and what you would need to do great science! 5? 7) can anyone speak to the housing market there? It looks like there aren't many houses under $400k based on a quick search 8) Given what (7) had discussed, anyone know if a remote position would be considered? 9) Theres places well below that price 25 min away in Poughkeepsie. 10) @8 This is one of the premier field research oriented institutes in the States. How would one run a program virtually? AP) Review date corrected. 11) @10 Nothing in the ad suggests they are only considering field researchers. It is absolutely possible to be an ecological scientist without conducting field work. I have the same question as @8 regarding the openess to remote work. 12) The way the salary is written in the ad as an ""annualized basis"" is not clear. Could be so many ways to interpret that 13) I interpret annualized basis as per year 14) In HR lingo ""annualized basis"" is total compensation provided to an employee in a year. So I agree it is not necessarily just salary they are including. Do they pull typical academic no summer salary shenanigans here? 15) It is a 12 month salary. This is a non-profit, if you are interested in seeing some of the staff's salaries, tax records are publically available.

Plant folks may look for job postings there. 4) @3 be nice to non-AG plant people, #2's sentiment is justified ;-) 5) Are references required by Sept 1 or not? Thanks. 6) @1 the current faculty salaries are published online: it seems to be around 67k$ for recently hired assistant profs. 7) seems to be $67k base, but summer salary can be added. so the number will go up when summer salary is included. (8) LOL, ""address important questions in invertebrate or vertebrate evolution"". Can anyone here suggest a few questions in vert/invert evolution that don't apply to non-animals? What is the role of teeth in diversification? How do eyes drive cognition? (9) As I understand it, this is a search for an evolutionary biologist (broadly defined)... who happens to work on invertebrates/vertebrates systems (notice that theoretical questions are mentioned). It seems that the questions can be anything within the scope of the search... 10) I just heard back from the chair of the search, turns out ANYONE that is an evolutionary biologist can apply (this includes PLANT folks too, as long as their core question fits within the scope of the search). So, yes, there is love for plants :) anyone that may be a good fit should apply! 11) Also, notice that, while there is no mention of a diversity statement in the description of the job part of the post, a diversity statement is REQUIRED (this is mentioned at the very bottom of the post). 11) ""as long as their core question fits within the scope of the search"" -- which is... all of evolution? Also, who's the search chair? 12) ""All of evolution"" -- YES. This is for a broad search for an evolutionary biologist. The chair is Brent Lockwood (bllockwo@uvm.edu ). 13) These broad ""evolutionary biology"" searches aren't that uncommon... if you work on evoution you should apply. Or talk to the chair if in doubt. Knowing and talking with people in the dept I know they care more about your cool questions than your system. 14)Looks like reference letters are due upfront, sigh why do they do this for generic searches... 15) @14, .. folks please read the ad carefully...

You can also teach less in the leave year, but for a reduction in pay. Can you clarify what you want to know about PTO in the context of a faculty job? We have access to FMLA and long-term disability, but PTO doesn't apply in the same way for full-time faculty at many institutions.12) Thanks for the info!","4","St Olaf College","TRUE","MN",174844,"Northfield","Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus","Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence","Not classified (Exclusively Undergraduate)","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Exclusively undergraduate four-year","Four-year, small, highly residential","Not Classified","Plains IA KS MN MO NE ND SD","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"Town Distant","No","No","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,980,0,0,0,0,980,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,866,114,0,0,3072,3149,2953,2928.333333,2953,0,2909,19,7,18,0,0,729,0,22,1,NA,NA,20,45,NA,182,0.185714,36,0,0,0,"Did not confer research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,0,0,0,2801,281,522,580,570,1150,25,23,24.300125,5231,2658,0.508125,3

The post says that adaptations to extreme environments is of special interest; thus why I figured it was worth putting on here.  4) This department partners with NASA, which has a big presence in the state.   I'd apply if it got me a tour of the former rocket launch room. 5) The field of research is properly called ""Astrobiology"". ""Space Biology"" makes it seem like they're looking for a GIS tech. x2  6) Seriously, check out NASA's Exobiology program. There are a lot of opportunities for contemporary ecology, but it's not on a lot of folks' radar. 7) there are some pretty solid people in this dept, but also issues...as for the loose boundary between Exobiology (formerly Astrobiology) and Space Biology, NASA re-structured its funding divisions and moved human related research (Space Biology) into the general science funding pool, with the increased push for manned missions and the effects on humans (ionizing radiation is a biggy in this field) the center of Space Biology is shifting to microbial research and away from animal models...but that could change again. There is also state funding, the Florida has state funding for space research. Just some comments from someone who was in the dept and is in this research field 7) the only way i'd work at a school in florida is if i could actually be in outer space most of the time x2  8) I have a colleague who could be a great fit for this, but the political backdrop is unsafe for one of his family members.  So he probably won't apply.  It's really unfortunate for a department that should recruit well otherwise. 9) I have a feeling at @7 is not a field biologist. Despite politics, there are a lot of reasons some biologists want to work in FL. x5 10) Yes.

We are increasing faculty & resources to keep up with increasing enrollment. Marine Science has only had one search. It was successful. More info about staffing is on our website.
