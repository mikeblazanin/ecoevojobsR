This is a full time, term appointment initially for 1 year, with possible yearly extension(s) contingent on performance and funding availability. The researcher will be working on projects relating to pollinator health in intensive agricultural systems in cooperation with multiple stakeholders in Stoneville, MS. The incumbent will have the flexibility of working on a wide range of topics relating to pollinator health in natural and agricultural landscapes focusing on nutritional ecology, plant-pollinator mutualisms, insect physiology, chemistry and/or toxicology. The primary goal will be to (i) improve the health of pollinators (managed honey bees as well as native bees) during these periods of changing climatic conditions, (ii) reduce the impact of stressors, including pesticides, pests, and pathogens on pollinators and (iii) develop ecosystem level approaches to sustain plant-pollinator populations and mutualisms for conserving bee and plant biodiversity sustainably in the face of large-scale agriculture.   

Specifics: This position requires a thorough knowledge of insect behavioral ecology and insect physiology. Additional preferred qualifications include strong theoretical and statistical skills, and proficiency in experimental design and data analyses. Supplemental knowledge of molecular techniques (to identify pollen source, genotype bees etc.) and floral chemistry are desirable. Willingness to work with bees in lab and field settings and learn beekeeping skills is a positive. Demonstrated ability in oral and written communication of research results is required.  

Qualification requirements: PhD. in biological sciences or related disciplines. Applicants must also meet U.S. citizenship or permanent residents who meet certain eligibility requirements may apply. Additional information on the employment of noncitizens can be found at this link. To apply for the position, please send (1) cover letter detailing your interest and fit for the position, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts to pierre.lau@usda.gov. Review of applicants begin on Friday, December 1, 2023 and will be ongoing.  

*ARS is an Equal Opportunity Employer and Provider*. Are you interested in working with our research unit? We're hiring *TWO* postdoctoral researchers to work project broadly related to pollinator health... A really wide range of topics are included and could be honey bees or wild bees, biodiversity, conservation, plant-pollinator interactions, agroecosystems, etc.

I'm not the main contact for the positions, but if you're interested and want to chat, I'm more than willing to answer questions about the research unit or about living and doing research in small town rural America.","Unmatched",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

important objective for science and society. However, meeting this objective is challenging
because environmental change comes in many different guises, and different communities
contain different species that grow and interact in their own distinct ways. We offer a
postdoctoral scholarship on theoretical ecology for up to two years at the lab of Frederik
De Laender at the University of Namur to address this challenge. More specifically, this
scholarship’s objective is to examine how differences between communities and between
environmental drivers lead to different effects on coexistence. While the literature is
replete with simulation models, the aim of this project is to achieve a more cross-cutting
understanding through a new theoretical approach and apply it to the cases of temperature
change and pollutants. 2) interested and how to apply? Email your CV and a motivation letter to F. De
Laender.

The postdoctoral associate will be part of a collaborative team (UCF, Yale University, University of Texas Tyler) working on NSF-funded research aimed at understanding how highly abundant social insects that live in the soil impact bacteria and fungi that live in or near their nests and how these, in turn, may impact organic soil carbon over local and large, regional scales. Translating local scale impacts across larger scales is a key part of the project.

In the rest of South America, Jacana jacana subspecies have brown plumage. We recently found a mutation in the ASIP gene, which correlates with this plumage difference. Our next steps are to build a phylogeny of the Jacana genus, potentially using whole genomes, to trace the evolutionary history of diversification in this group, relative to hybridization and this plumage mutation. We also plan to run additional PCRs on ASIP and MC1R across the genus. 2) Position filled","Match, exact","Duke University","NC",198419,"Durham","R1 Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence","Research Doctoral: Comprehensive programs, with medical/veterinary school","Four-year, full-time, more selective, lower transfer-in","Majority graduate","Four-year, large, highly residential","Classified","Southeast AL AR FL GA KY LA MS NC SC TN VA WV","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Four or more years","Private not-for-profit",1,"City Large","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"No","No","No","No","No",0,2405,3343,568,370,0,6686,1180209,16429,1211,3573,54,34,229,251,317,251,1238,2475,1609,796,0,0,16768,17855,16172,15625.333333,6717,9455,6542,108,30,37,8780,675,1580,0,35,0,NA,NA,24,52,NA,1291,0.19309,49,130,33,0.673469,"Conferred research/scholarship doctoral degrees",0,0,1,24,18,5773,954,956,720,750,1470,34,32,33.001047,39639,3068,0.077399,3

Despite its significance, the origins of date palm diversity remain shrouded in mystery. Notably, distinct genepools have been recognized in West Asia and North Africa. Positioned at the crossroads of these genepools and civilizations for countless millennia, the Levant emerges as a pivotal region. However, the precise origins of date palm cultivation in the region and the sources of these genepools continue to elude us.
In this compelling research endeavor, our objective is to characterize the date palm populations in the southern Levant, and unravel their cultivation origin. Through the comprehensive analysis of numerous modern and ancient genomes across the region, as well as seed morphometric data from both modern and archaeological seeds, we aim to study the intricate interplay of biological, ecological, historical, and human factors that have shaped the diverse landscape of date palms in the southern Levantine region. This multidisciplinary approach will provide invaluable insights into the demographic and selective processes that have influenced the diversity of date palms, facilitating the development of effective conservation and improvement programs.","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The first position will focus on mapping and measuring changes to ecosystem services and associated benefits from Great Lakes coastal ecosystem restoration efforts. This research will include measuring how benefits change due to climate change, particularly future change in lake levels. The goal of this project is to forecast how changes in ecosystem services could influence human communities within neighborhoods and urban areas. Ideal candidates could have experience in one or more of the following fields: ecology, biology, environmental science, epidemiology, public health, geography, environmental economics, or a related field.
The second position will focus on community resources and capacities. This project intends to use social science case study methodologies to better understand community values, decisions, abilities, and actions in relation to environmental concerns. Ideal candidates could have experience in one or more of the following fields: geography, environmental studies, anthropology, sociology, or a related field.
Work from both of these postdoctoral positions will support ongoing remediation and restoration projects led by EPA Great Lakes National Program Office. The postdocs will join an interdisciplinary team of researchers including social scientists and ecologists focused on translational ecology, an approach in which scientists, stakeholders, and decision makers together develop solutions that address sociological, ecological, and political contexts of environmental problems.
