Develop your own project with internal materials/travel funding and technical support. Position renewable to 3 years+ based on progress, Start date flexible in 2024/2025. Benefits include housing stipend, relocation, childcare subsidy, ongoing assistance for life in Okinawa. 1) Isolated island, good for a few years but most people tend to want off 2) Confused how an island with millions of people, huge cities, and cheap, direct flights to Tokyo, HK, Taiwan, Singapore, and Seoul can be called 'isolated'. 3)The institute is a good distance away from the Nara Airport, ""huge"" cities are not necessarily there. There's nothing much around the immediate vicinity of their campus. 4) PhD student at institute, can say it is isolating at times and can be difficult to maintain and create collaborative networks, island life gets tiring fast (but may be different for others) 5) Has any OIST postdoc ever been ""promoted"" to a Faculty position there? 6) @7 no, it's against internal policy. 7) PI is known for power harrassment issues; 8) @7 is it possible to elaborate further? Further context would be really helpful before I decide not to apply. 8) I know many OIST students, they all say the same thing in terms of isolation, especially because the physical location of the institute is far from the main city of Naha. 9) Perspective from a current postdoc in this unit: my experiences have been overwhelmingly positive and I have greatly enjoyed working with Lauren and the other members of the unit. Collaborative environment, many opportunities (and funding!) to work on independent research projects, mentorship opportunities with interns and students, and emphasis on work/life balance. A car is essential, but coming from a big city, I enjoy how easy it is to do outdoor activities (especially diving/snorkeling) and find that I can get everything I need here.

This is a full time, term appointment initially for 1 year, with possible yearly extension(s) contingent on performance and funding availability. The researcher will be working on projects relating to pollinator health in intensive agricultural systems in cooperation with multiple stakeholders in Stoneville, MS. The incumbent will have the flexibility of working on a wide range of topics relating to pollinator health in natural and agricultural landscapes focusing on nutritional ecology, plant-pollinator mutualisms, insect physiology, chemistry and/or toxicology. The primary goal will be to (i) improve the health of pollinators (managed honey bees as well as native bees) during these periods of changing climatic conditions, (ii) reduce the impact of stressors, including pesticides, pests, and pathogens on pollinators and (iii) develop ecosystem level approaches to sustain plant-pollinator populations and mutualisms for conserving bee and plant biodiversity sustainably in the face of large-scale agriculture.   

Specifics: This position requires a thorough knowledge of insect behavioral ecology and insect physiology. Additional preferred qualifications include strong theoretical and statistical skills, and proficiency in experimental design and data analyses. Supplemental knowledge of molecular techniques (to identify pollen source, genotype bees etc.) and floral chemistry are desirable. Willingness to work with bees in lab and field settings and learn beekeeping skills is a positive. Demonstrated ability in oral and written communication of research results is required.  

Qualification requirements: PhD. in biological sciences or related disciplines. Applicants must also meet U.S. citizenship or permanent residents who meet certain eligibility requirements may apply. Additional information on the employment of noncitizens can be found at this link. To apply for the position, please send (1) cover letter detailing your interest and fit for the position, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts to pierre.lau@usda.gov. Review of applicants begin on Friday, December 1, 2023 and will be ongoing.  

*ARS is an Equal Opportunity Employer and Provider*. Are you interested in working with our research unit? We're hiring *TWO* postdoctoral researchers to work project broadly related to pollinator health... A really wide range of topics are included and could be honey bees or wild bees, biodiversity, conservation, plant-pollinator interactions, agroecosystems, etc.

important objective for science and society. However, meeting this objective is challenging
because environmental change comes in many different guises, and different communities
contain different species that grow and interact in their own distinct ways. We offer a
postdoctoral scholarship on theoretical ecology for up to two years at the lab of Frederik
De Laender at the University of Namur to address this challenge. More specifically, this
scholarship’s objective is to examine how differences between communities and between
environmental drivers lead to different effects on coexistence. While the literature is
replete with simulation models, the aim of this project is to achieve a more cross-cutting
understanding through a new theoretical approach and apply it to the cases of temperature
change and pollutants. 2) interested and how to apply? Email your CV and a motivation letter to F. De
Laender.

The position is funded by the USGS John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis. One of the projects will be focused on evaluating the interaction between diversity and climate history in predicting ecosystem stability, resistance, and recovery to “climate shocks” (i.e., heatwaves and droughts) using a cutting-edge statistical approach to synthesize existing long-term datasets across an unprecedented gradient of species richness. Additional projects will include a review paper, a paper focused on foundation species resilience to climate shocks, as well as other papers that emerge from working group brainstorming sessions. We seek a candidate with a background in quantitative ecology to collate and analyze the data and lead resulting publications.

Our research team has been conducting coordinated, targeted surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and Chronic Wasting Disease in deer across 12 study sites in the USA. Data being collected include GPS location data, longitudinally replicated animal-level physiological data, and a variety of SARS-CoV-2 and CWD diagnostics. Funding for positions is available now. We are looking for motivated analysts with complementary skills to work collaboratively towards the research programs objectives. We are particularly excited about recruiting individuals with strong interests in interdisciplinary disease ecology and specific skills in at least one related research area, such as epidemiological modeling, movement ecology, statistical inference, phylodynamics or geography, or machine learning. The task of these new team members will be to develop, refine, and implement methods to analyze data emerging from the surveillance program. 

Candidates will be housed at one of our team institutions, and will interface with the national group through biweekly all-hands meetings and more frequent in-depth discussions (including, for example, a topics lab exploring emerging techniques at the movement-disease interface). We will foster collaborative relationships between the post-docs and affiliated faculty through team retreats, co-led papers, and a strong collaborative culture.

Despite its significance, the origins of date palm diversity remain shrouded in mystery. Notably, distinct genepools have been recognized in West Asia and North Africa. Positioned at the crossroads of these genepools and civilizations for countless millennia, the Levant emerges as a pivotal region. However, the precise origins of date palm cultivation in the region and the sources of these genepools continue to elude us.
In this compelling research endeavor, our objective is to characterize the date palm populations in the southern Levant, and unravel their cultivation origin. Through the comprehensive analysis of numerous modern and ancient genomes across the region, as well as seed morphometric data from both modern and archaeological seeds, we aim to study the intricate interplay of biological, ecological, historical, and human factors that have shaped the diverse landscape of date palms in the southern Levantine region. This multidisciplinary approach will provide invaluable insights into the demographic and selective processes that have influenced the diversity of date palms, facilitating the development of effective conservation and improvement programs.","International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including AI and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computing (HPC) clusters. The objective of this fellowship is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or requiring the HPC environment.

The first position will focus on mapping and measuring changes to ecosystem services and associated benefits from Great Lakes coastal ecosystem restoration efforts. This research will include measuring how benefits change due to climate change, particularly future change in lake levels. The goal of this project is to forecast how changes in ecosystem services could influence human communities within neighborhoods and urban areas. Ideal candidates could have experience in one or more of the following fields: ecology, biology, environmental science, epidemiology, public health, geography, environmental economics, or a related field.
The second position will focus on community resources and capacities. This project intends to use social science case study methodologies to better understand community values, decisions, abilities, and actions in relation to environmental concerns. Ideal candidates could have experience in one or more of the following fields: geography, environmental studies, anthropology, sociology, or a related field.
Work from both of these postdoctoral positions will support ongoing remediation and restoration projects led by EPA Great Lakes National Program Office. The postdocs will join an interdisciplinary team of researchers including social scientists and ecologists focused on translational ecology, an approach in which scientists, stakeholders, and decision makers together develop solutions that address sociological, ecological, and political contexts of environmental problems. The PI’s leading this work include Joel Hoffman (hoffman.joel@epa.gov), Katie Williams (williams.kathleen@epa.gov), and Samantha Rumschlag (rusmchlag.samantha@epa.gov). Interested candidates should be in touch via email ahead of the job posting to express interest. The job posting will occur towards the end of May via Zintellect (https://www.zintellect.com/), where candidates can apply. This position description serves as a tool for recruiting ahead of the job posting. Anticipated applications materials include a cover letter and CV/resume.
