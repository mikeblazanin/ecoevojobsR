The pay (and health insurance) is significantly better than comprable institutions (e.g., ivy league schools, land grants, etc). Very few top tier universities have unions for grad students let alone postdocs - it's better to have some support than none. 3) Agree with 2. Also, UC postdocs get matched retirement contributions. No other place I've been (big R1 land grants) do the same. The pay is also leagues above most comparable institutions.
