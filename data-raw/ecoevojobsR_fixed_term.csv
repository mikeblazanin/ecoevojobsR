These kinds of positions can be great springboards to a TT position elsewhere though. 6) This is definitely a strange ad. A lot of it reads like typical TT SLAC job ad (with the heavy emphasis on involving undergrads in research and the preference for postdoc experience), but it's a 1-year VAP? Are they actually expecting people to establish a ""dynamic research program"" and involve undergrads within that span? While also teaching? 7) Also really curious to know the fate of their September search. It'd be a shame if it had failed. 8) Can confirm, the fall 2023 Ecology position was a failed search. 2) is the expectation that this VAP may fill the TT position in future? 9) @2... isn't that always the question!! 1) Lol for this ad I'd say it better be inside track for the TT position. If not it's just ""postdoc experience preferred for a position more demanding and more precarious than most postdocs"" 2) I guess the question for me here is going to be whether they are forward about it during interviews 10) Every VAP is exactly that though... you get ""a position more demanding and more precarious than most postdocs"", while simultaneously being a cheaper disposable option while filling the university's need for a permanent position. As a former VAP - can confirm, it is predatory. I taught more classes, with more students than any of the TT faculty for $25-50k less. We DO NOT NEED more training y'all, I have a terminal degree and two postdocs already.

Expected Start date: August 1, 2024 Review of applications is ongoing and will continue until the position is filled.

Faculty member here - I really love our dept and Louisville is a fun city to live in. Still affordable and a bit of a hidden gem.
1) this shouldn't have the full description in it, and isnt it a permanent position 2) It's in the fixed-term tab... 3) but its equivalent to jobs that are full-time lecturers and get reappointed every year or 2 years.
